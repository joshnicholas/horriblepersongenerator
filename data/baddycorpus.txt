scrooge signed it and scrooge s name was good upon change for anything he chose to put his hand to scrooge knew he was dead of course he did how could it be otherwise scrooge and he were partners for i don t know how many years scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain scrooge never painted out old marley s name there it stood years afterwards above the warehouse door scrooge and marley the firm was known as scrooge and marley sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names oh but he was a tight fisted hand at the grindstone scrooge a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire secret and self contained and solitary as an oyster external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge they often came down handsomely and scrooge never did nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks my dear scrooge how are you when will you come to see me no beggars implored him to bestow a trifle no children asked him what it was o clock no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place of scrooge even the blind men s dogs appeared to know him and when they saw him coming on would tug their owners into doorways and up courts and then would wag their tails as though they said no eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master but what did scrooge care it was the very thing he liked to edge his way along the crowded paths of life warning all human sympathy to keep its distance was what the knowing ones call nuts to scrooge once upon a time of all the good days in the year on christmas eve old scrooge sat busy in his counting house the door of scrooge s counting house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank was copying letters scrooge had a very small fire but the clerk s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal but he couldn t replenish it for scrooge kept the coal box in his own room and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part it was the voice of scrooge s nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach bah said scrooge humbug he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this nephew of scrooge s that he was all in a glow his face was ruddy and handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again christmas a humbug uncle said scrooge s nephew you don t mean that i am sure i do said scrooge scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said bah again and followed it up with humbug don t be cross uncle said the nephew what else can i be returned the uncle when i live in such a world of fools as this merry christmas out upon merry christmas what s christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money a time for finding yourself a year older and not an hour richer a time for balancing your books and having every item in em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you if i could work my will said scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with merry christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart keep it repeated scrooge s nephew let me leave it alone then said scrooge let me hear another sound from you said scrooge and you ll keep your christmas by losing your situation you re quite a powerful speaker sir he added turning to his nephew scrooge said that he would see him yes indeed he did but why cried scrooge s nephew why why did you get married said scrooge because you fell in love growled scrooge as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas why give it as a reason for not coming now good afternoon said scrooge i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why cannot we be friends good afternoon said scrooge so a merry christmas uncle good afternoon said scrooge and a happy new year good afternoon said scrooge he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold as he was was warmer than scrooge for he returned them cordially there s another fellow muttered scrooge who overheard him my clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking about a merry christmas this lunatic in letting scrooge s nephew out had let two other people in they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in scrooge s office scrooge and marley s i believe said one of the gentlemen referring to his list scrooge or mr marley has been dead these seven years scrooge replied at the ominous word liberality scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back scrooge said the gentleman taking up a pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time are there no prisons asked scrooge and the union workhouses demanded scrooge the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then said scrooge oh i was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course said scrooge what shall i put you down for nothing scrooge replied you wish to be anonymous i wish to be left alone said scrooge if they would rather die said scrooge they had better do it and decrease the surplus population it s not my business scrooge returned scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him the ancient tower of a church whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall became invisible and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there the owner of one scant young nose gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs stooped down at scrooge s keyhole to regale him with a christmas carol but at the first sound of god bless you merry gentleman may nothing you dismay scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost with an ill will scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat you ll want all day to morrow i suppose said scrooge it s not convenient said scrooge and it s not fair and yet said scrooge you don t think me ill used when i pay a day s wages for no work a poor excuse for picking a man s pocket every twenty fifth of december said scrooge buttoning his greatcoat to the chin the clerk promised that he would and scrooge walked out with a growl scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker s book went home to bed it was old enough now and dreary enough for nobody lived in it but scrooge the other rooms being all let out as offices the yard was so dark that even scrooge who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands it is also a fact that scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence in that place also that scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of london even including which is a bold word the corporation aldermen and livery let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon and then let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate process of change not a knocker but marley s face it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge as marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it was a knocker again scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes there was plenty of width for that and room to spare which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom half a dozen gas lamps out of the street wouldn t have lighted the entry too well so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooge s dip up scrooge went not caring a button for that darkness is cheap and scrooge liked it nobody under the table nobody under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel scrooge had a cold in his head upon the hob humbug said scrooge and walked across the room scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains it s humbug still said scrooge it was long and wound about him like a tail and it was made for scrooge observed it closely of cash boxes keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel his body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no bowels but he had never believed it until now how now said scrooge caustic and cold as ever who were you then said scrooge raising his voice can you can you sit down asked scrooge looking doubtfully at him scrooge asked the question because he didn t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair and felt that in the event of its being impossible it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation i don t said scrooge what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own senses i don t know said scrooge why do you doubt your senses because said scrooge a little thing affects them there s more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him scrooge could not feel it himself but this was clearly the case for though the ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven you see this toothpick said scrooge returning quickly to the charge for the reason just assigned and wishing though it were only for a second to divert the vision s stony gaze from himself you are not looking at it said scrooge well returned scrooge i have but to swallow this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins all of my own creation humbug i tell you humbug at this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise that scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in a swoon but how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round his head as if it were too warm to wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face dreadful apparition why do you trouble me man of the worldly mind replied the ghost do you believe in me or not i do said scrooge i must you are fettered said scrooge trembling is its pattern strange to you scrooge trembled more and more it is a ponderous chain scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he could see nothing it comes from other regions ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men my spirit never walked beyond our counting house mark me in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money changing hole and weary journeys lie before me it was a habit with scrooge whenever he became thoughtful to put his hands in his breeches pockets illustration on the wings of the wind you must have been very slow about it jacob scrooge observed in a business like manner though with humility and deference seven years dead mused scrooge you travel fast said scrooge you might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years said scrooge oh captive bound and double ironed cried the phantom not to know that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life s opportunities misused yet such was i oh such was i but you were always a good man of business jacob faltered scrooge who now began to apply this to himself why did i walk through crowds of fellow beings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate and began to quake exceedingly i will said scrooge scrooge shivered and wiped the perspiration from his brow you were always a good friend to me said scrooge scrooge s countenance fell almost as low as the ghost s had done i i think i d rather not said scrooge couldn t i take em all at once and have it over jacob hinted scrooge scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage it beckoned scrooge to approach which he did scrooge stopped scrooge followed to the window desperate in his curiosity many had been personally known to scrooge in their lives scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had entered illustration stave two illustration the first of the three spirits when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber why it isn t possible said scrooge that i can have slept through a whole day and far into another night ebenezer scrooge or his order and so forth would have become a mere united states security if there were no days to count by scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over and over and could make nothing of it every time he resolved within himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first position and presented the same problem to be worked all through was it a dream or not scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more when he remembered on a sudden that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one ding dong a quarter past said scrooge counting ding dong half past said scrooge said scrooge ding dong the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else he spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with a deep dull hollow melancholy one the curtains of his bed were drawn aside and scrooge starting up into a half recumbent attitude found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them as close to it as i am now to you and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness was not its strangest quality are you the spirit sir whose coming was foretold to me asked scrooge who and what are you scrooge demanded long past inquired scrooge observant of its dwarfish stature perhaps scrooge could not have told anybody why if anybody could have asked him but he had a special desire to see the spirit in his cap and begged him to be covered what exclaimed the ghost would you so soon put out with worldly hands the light i give is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the spirit at any period of his life scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end rise and walk with me it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below freezing that he was clad but lightly in his slippers dressing gown and nightcap and that he had a cold upon him at that time i am a mortal scrooge remonstrated and liable to fall good heaven said scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked about him and what is that upon your cheek scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a pimple and begged the ghost to lead him where he would remember it cried scrooge with fervour i could walk it blindfold they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little market town appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named them every one why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas as they parted at cross roads and by ways for their several homes what was merry christmas to scrooge out upon merry christmas what good had it ever done to him the school is not quite deserted said the ghost scrooge said he knew it they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he had used to be not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the half thawed waterspout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears why it s ali baba scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy poor boy and valentine said scrooge and his wild brother orson there they go and what s his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus don t you see him and the sultan s groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right i m glad of it what business had he to be married to the princess to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed there s the parrot cried scrooge i wish scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff but it s too late now nothing said scrooge the ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand saying as it did so let us see another christmas scrooge s former self grew larger at the words and the room became a little darker and more dirty the panels shrunk the windows cracked fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling and the naked laths were shown instead but how all this was brought about scrooge knew no more than you do scrooge looked at the ghost and with a mournful shaking of his head glanced anxiously towards the door a terrible voice in the hall cried bring down master scrooge s box there and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious condescension and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him master scrooge s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise the children bade the schoolmaster good bye right willingly and getting into it drove gaily down the garden sweep the quick wheels dashing the hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray but she had a large heart so she had cried scrooge one child scrooge returned your nephew scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind and answered briefly yes the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked scrooge if he knew it know it said scrooge at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great excitement why it s old fezziwig bless his heart it s fezziwig alive again old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice yo ho there ebenezer dick scrooge s former self now grown a young man came briskly in accompanied by his fellow prentice dick wilkins to be sure said scrooge to the ghost during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits small echoed scrooge is that so much that he deserves this praise it isn t that said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self nothing particular said scrooge no said scrooge no his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by side in the open air quick this was not addressed to scrooge or to any one whom he could see but it produced an immediate effect for again scrooge saw himself spirit said scrooge show me no more conduct me home no more cried scrooge near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more children there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting itself like forty and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of the house having his daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside and when he thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have called him father and been a spring time in the haggard winter of his life his sight grew very dim indeed scrooge scrooge it was spirit said scrooge in a broken voice remove me from this place that they are what they are do not blame me remove me scrooge exclaimed i cannot bear it he turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a face in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it haunt me no longer in the struggle if that can be called a struggle in which the ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright and dimly connecting that with its influence over him he seized the extinguisher cap and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head illustration laden with christmas toys and presents the spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its whole form but though scrooge pressed it down with all his force he could not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken flood upon the ground illustration stave three illustration the second of the three spirits awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of one without venturing for scrooge quite as hardily as this i don t mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances and that nothing between a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much the moment scrooge s hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by his name and bade him enter the crisp leaves of holly mistletoe and ivy reflected back the light as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in scrooge s time or marley s or for many and many a winter season gone in easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly giant glorious to see who bore a glowing torch in shape not unlike plenty s horn and held it up high up to shed its light on scrooge as he came peeping round the door come in and know me better man scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before this spirit he was not the dogged scrooge he had been and though the spirit s eyes were clear and kind he did not like to meet them look upon me scrooge reverently did so never scrooge made answer to it i don t think i have said scrooge a tremendous family to provide for muttered scrooge spirit said scrooge submissively conduct me where you will touch my robe scrooge did as he was told and held it fast the sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with scrooge beside him in a baker s doorway and taking off the covers as their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch asked scrooge would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day asked scrooge why to a poor one most asked scrooge spirit said scrooge after a moment s thought i wonder you of all the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these people s opportunities of innocent enjoyment you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all said scrooge wouldn t you i cried the spirit you seek to close these places on the seventh day said scrooge it has been done in your name or at least in that of your family said scrooge scrooge promised that he would and they went on invisible as they had been before into the suburbs of the town it was a remarkable quality of the ghost which scrooge had observed at the baker s that notwithstanding his gigantic size he could accommodate himself to any place with ease and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing off this power of his or else it was his own kind generous hearty nature and his sympathy with all poor men that led him straight to scrooge s clerk s for there he went and took scrooge with him holding to his robe and on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled and stopped to bless bob cratchit s dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch spirit said scrooge with an interest he had never felt before tell me if tiny tim will live no no said scrooge scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit and was overcome with penitence and grief o god to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust scrooge bent before the ghost s rebuke and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground scrooge said bob scrooge the founder of the feast the founder of the feast indeed cried mrs scrooge scrooge was the ogre of the family after it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done with but they were happy grateful pleased with one another and contented with the time and when they faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the spirit s torch at parting scrooge had his eye upon them and especially on tiny tim until the last by this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily and as scrooge and the spirit went along the streets the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens parlours and all sorts of rooms was wonderful what place is this asked scrooge the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor sped whither not to sea to sea to scrooge s horror looking back he saw the last of the land a frightful range of rocks behind them and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving sea on on until being far away as he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on a ship it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets as profound as death it was a great surprise to scrooge while thus engaged to hear a hearty laugh it was a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew s and to find himself in a bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability ha ha laughed scrooge s nephew ha ha ha if you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blessed in a laugh than scrooge s nephew all i can say is i should like to know him too when scrooge s nephew laughed in this way holding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions scrooge s niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he ha ha ha ha ha ha he said that christmas was a humbug as i live cried scrooge s nephew he believed it too more shame for him fred said scrooge s niece indignantly oh perfectly satisfactory he s a comical old fellow said scrooge s nephew that s the truth and not so pleasant as he might be i m sure he is very rich fred hinted scrooge s niece what of that my dear said scrooge s nephew i have no patience with him observed scrooge s niece scrooge s niece s sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion oh i have said scrooge s nephew indeed i think he loses a very good dinner interrupted scrooge s niece well i am very glad to hear it said scrooge s nephew because i haven t any great faith in these young housekeepers what do you say topper topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge s niece s sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject whereat scrooge s niece s sister the plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the roses blushed do go on fred said scrooge s niece clapping her hands he never finishes what he begins to say he is such a ridiculous fellow scrooge s nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed i was only going to say said scrooge s nephew that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as i think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm he may rail at christmas till he dies but he can t help thinking better of it i defy him if he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it only put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds that s something and i think i shook him yesterday it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge scrooge s niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes a simple little air a mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two minutes which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the boarding school as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past my opinion is that it was a done thing between him and scrooge s nephew and that the ghost of christmas present knew it scrooge s niece was not one of the blind man s buff party but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her likewise at the game of how when and where she was very great and to the secret joy of scrooge s nephew beat her sisters hollow though they were sharp girls too as topper could have told you there might have been twenty people there young and old but they all played and so did scrooge for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that his voice made no sound in their ears he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud and very often guessed right too for the sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not to cut in the eye was not sharper than scrooge blunt as he took it in his head to be here is a new game said scrooge one half hour spirit only one it was a game called yes and no where scrooge s nephew had to think of something and the rest must find out what he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case was scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency that way here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment and i say uncle scrooge well uncle scrooge they cried a merry christmas and a happy new year to the old man whatever he is said scrooge s nephew uncle scrooge uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked them in an inaudible speech if the ghost had given him time in almshouse hospital and gaol in misery s every refuge where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door and barred the spirit out he left his blessing and taught scrooge his precepts it was a long night if it were only a night but scrooge had his doubts of this because the christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together it was strange too that while scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form the ghost grew older clearly older scrooge had observed this change but never spoke of it until they left a children s twelfth night party when looking at the spirit as they stood together in an open place he noticed that its hair was grey are spirits lives so short asked scrooge to night cried scrooge forgive me if i am not justified in what i ask said scrooge looking intently at the spirit s robe but i see something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts scrooge started back appalled spirit are they yours scrooge could say no more slander those who tell it ye admit it for your factious purposes and make it worse and bide the end have they no refuge or resource cried scrooge scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not when it came near him scrooge bent down upon his knee for in the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery i am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come said scrooge you are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen in the time before us scrooge pursued although well used to ghostly company by this time scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it but scrooge was all the worse for this lead on said scrooge scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress which bore him up he thought and carried him along but there they were in the heart of it on change amongst the merchants who hurried up and down and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in groups and looked at their watches and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals and so forth as scrooge had seen them often observing that the hand was pointed to them scrooge advanced to listen to their talk scrooge knew the men and looked towards the spirit for an explanation scrooge listened again thinking that the explanation might lie here scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose he set himself to consider what it was likely to be they left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town where scrooge had never penetrated before although he recognised its situation and its bad repute scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror this is the end of it you see he frightened every one away from him when he was alive to profit us when he was dead ha ha ha spirit said scrooge shuddering from head to foot the room was very dark too dark to be observed with any accuracy though scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse anxious to know what kind of room it was scrooge glanced towards the phantom the cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it the motion of a finger upon scrooge s part would have disclosed the face strike shadow strike and see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow the world with life immortal no voice pronounced these words in scrooge s ears and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed what they wanted in the room of death and why they were so restless and disturbed scrooge did not dare to think i understand you scrooge returned and i would do it if i could if there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this man s death said scrooge quite agonised show that person to me spirit i beseech you the phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment like a wing and withdrawing it revealed a room by daylight where a mother and her children were let me see some tenderness connected with a death said scrooge or that dark chamber spirit which we left just now will be for ever present to me the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet and as they went along scrooge looked here and there to find himself but nowhere was he to be seen where had scrooge heard those words he had not dreamed them scrooge s nephew whom he had scarcely seen but once and who meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked a little just a little down you know said bob inquired what had happened to distress him spirit of tiny tim thy childish essence was from god spectre said scrooge something informs me that our parting moment is at hand indeed the spirit did not stay for anything but went straight on as to the end just now desired until besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment this court said scrooge through which we hurry now is where my place of occupation is and has been for a length of time the house is yonder scrooge exclaimed scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point said scrooge answer me one question men s courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if persevered in they must lead said scrooge scrooge crept towards it trembling as he went and following the finger read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name ebenezer scrooge best and happiest of all the time before him was his own to make amends in i will live in the past the present and the future scrooge repeated as he scrambled out of bed they are not torn down cried scrooge folding one of his bed curtains in his arms they are not torn down rings and all i don t know what to do cried scrooge laughing and crying in the same breath and making a perfect laocoon of himself with his stockings there s the saucepan that the gruel was in cried scrooge starting off again and going round the fireplace the father of a long long line of brilliant laughs i don t know what day of the month it is said scrooge oh glorious glorious what s to day cried scrooge calling downward to a boy in sunday clothes who perhaps had loitered in to look about him what s to day my fine fellow said scrooge it s christmas day said scrooge to himself do you know the poulterer s in the next street but one at the corner scrooge inquired an intelligent boy said scrooge what a delightful boy said scrooge is it said scrooge no no said scrooge i ll send it to bob cratchit s whispered scrooge rubbing his hands and splitting with a laugh i shall love it as long as i live cried scrooge patting it with his hand why it s impossible to carry that to camden town said scrooge the people were by this time pouring forth as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present and walking with his hands behind him scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile he looked so irresistibly pleasant in a word that three or four good humoured fellows said good morning sir a merry christmas to you and scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard those were the blithest in his ears he had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his counting house the day before and said scrooge and marley s i believe it sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met but he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it my dear sir said scrooge quickening his pace and taking the old gentleman by both his hands how do you do i hope you succeeded yesterday scrooge yes said scrooge and will you have the goodness here scrooge whispered in his ear scrooge are you serious if you please said scrooge will you do me that favour my dear sir said the other shaking hands with him i don t know what to say to such munifi don t say anything please retorted scrooge thankee said scrooge is your master at home my dear said scrooge to the girl where is he my love said scrooge he knows me said scrooge with his hand already on the dining room lock fred said scrooge dear heart alive how his niece by marriage started scrooge had forgotten for the moment about her sitting in the corner with the footstool or he wouldn t have done it on any account why bless my soul cried fred who s that illustration it s i your uncle scrooge your uncle scrooge scrooge sat with his door wide open that he might see him come into the tank hallo growled scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could feign it you are repeated scrooge now i ll tell you what my friend said scrooge he had a momentary idea of knocking scrooge down with it holding him and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait waistcoat a merry christmas bob said scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken as he clapped him on the back a merrier christmas bob my good fellow than i have given you for many a year i ll raise your salary and endeavour to assist your struggling family and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a christmas bowl of smoking bishop bob make up the fires and buy another coal scuttle before you dot another i bob cratchit illustration now i ll tell you what my friend said scrooge scrooge was better than his word is fagin upstairs yes he s a sortin the wipes this is him fagin said jack dawkins my friend oliver twist never poached upon old fagin and why should they it wouldn t have loosened the knot or kept the drop up a minute longer and what have you got my dear said fagin to charley bates there my dear said fagin what ll fagin say inquired the dodger taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question fagin looked so very much in earnest that charley bates who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second dropped upon his knees and raised a loud well sustained and continuous roar something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet wot s it all about fagin d me if my neck handkercher an t lined with beer come in you sneaking warmint wot are you stopping outside for as if you was ashamed of your master come in the man who growled out these words was a stoutly built fellow of about five and thirty in a black velveteen coat very soiled drab breeches lace up half boots and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs with large swelling calves the kind of legs which in such costume always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them you re blowed upon fagin this was that the dodger and charley bates and fagin and mr nancy my dear said the jew in a soothing manner what do you say that it won t do so it s no use a trying it on fagin replied nancy she ll go fagin said sikes no she won t fagin said nancy yes she will fagin said sikes give her a door key to carry in her t other one fagin said sikes it looks real and genivine like i didn t know my dear i didn t know replied fagin humbly for the jew was the new comer sneaking in and out so as nobody hears how you come or go i wish you had been the dog fagin half a minute ago i ve got the upper hand over you fagin and d me i ll keep it well what have you got to say to me it s all passed safe through the melting pot replied fagin and this is your share it was answered by another jew younger than fagin but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance the jew perfectly understanding the hint retired to fill it previously exchanging a remarkable look with fagin who raised his eyes for an instant as if in expectation of it and shook his head in reply so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person is anybody here barney inquired fagin speaking now that that sikes was looking on without raising his eyes from the ground nobody inquired fagin in a tone of surprise which perhaps might mean that barney was at liberty to tell the truth barney looked timidly at fagin as if for permission the jew remaining silent and not lifting his eyes from the ground he retired and presently returned ushering in nancy who was decorated with the bonnet apron basket and street door key complete the young brat s been ill and confined to the crib and ah nancy dear said fagin looking up fagin was seized with a fit of coughing upon which nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders and declared it was time to go oh my wig my wig cried master charles bates from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded here he is oh cry here he is oh fagin look at him fagin do look at him i can t bear it it is such a jolly game i cant bear it look at his togs fagin said charley putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire look at his togs superfine cloth and the heavy swell cut oh my eye what a game and his books too nothing but a gentleman fagin delighted to see you looking so well my dear said the jew bowing with mock humility at his master bates roared again so loud that fagin himself relaxed and even the dodger smiled but as the artful drew forth the five pound note at that instant it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment that s mine fagin the boy s right remarked fagin looking covertly round and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot what s the matter here said fagin looking round no she hasn t said nancy pale and breathless from the scuffle no she hasn t fagin don t think it fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which nancy belonged to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her at present i won t stand by and see it done fagin cried the girl you will be the worse for it fagin if i do and so i tell you in good time to keep clear of me i suppose he d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow fagin had he inquired charley bates brownlow s and the accidental display of which to fagin by the jew who purchased them had been the very first clue received of his whereabout put off the smart ones said charley and i ll give em to fagin to take care of fagin took the opportunity of reading oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty to no ordinary extent in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends and still more in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken oliver in and cherished him when without his timely aid he might have perished with hunger and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom in his philanthropy he had succoured under parallel circumstances but who proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police had unfortunately come to be hanged at the old bailey one morning fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown which if it were not precisely true was indispensably necessary for the safety of him mr fagin and a few select friends fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging and with great friendliness and politeness of manner expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit oliver twist to that unpleasant operation so s fagin why don t you put yourself under fagin oliver and make your fortun out of hand added the dodger with a grin and fagin would rather not rejoined charley that rejoined the dodger with a wave of his pipe that was all out of consideration for fagin cause the traps know that we work together and he might have got into trouble if we hadn t made our lucky that was the move wasn t it charley master bates nodded assent and would have spoken but the recollection of oliver s flight came so suddenly upon him that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh and went up into his head and down into his throat and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping about five minutes long fagin will make something of you though or you ll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led interspersed with a variety of hints to oliver that the best thing he could do would be to secure fagin s favour without more delay by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it he s in luck then said the young man with a meaning look at fagin after some more jokes on the same subject they exchanged a few short whispers with fagin and withdrew after some words apart between the last comer and fagin they drew their chairs towards the fire and the jew telling oliver to come and sit by him led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers fagin best knew fagin s outer garment for as the jew unbuttoned it and threw it over the back of a chair he retired to the corner from which he had risen wagging his tail as he went to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be fagin and his young friend had not met since she had interfered in behalf of oliver she took her feet off the fender pushed back her chair and bade fagin draw up his without saying more about it for it was a cold night and no mistake fagin said sikes abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed is it worth fifty shiners extra if it s safely done from the outside yes said the jew as suddenly rousing himself nonsense rejoined the girl coolly go on fagin why you don t mind the old girl do you fagin he asked at length now fagin said nancy with a laugh i know he is rejoined fagin you won t see him alive again fagin sikes expressive of the disgust with which he received fagin s affectation of humanity after some discussion in which all three took an active part it was decided that nancy should repair to the jew s next evening when the night had set in and bring oliver away with her fagin craftily observing that if he evinced any disinclination to the task he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf than anybody else fagin wended his way through mud and mire to his gloomy abode where the dodger was sitting up impatiently awaiting his return why do you think inquired fagin parrying the question the jew seemed much vexed by oliver s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject but the truth is that although oliver felt very anxious he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of fagin s looks and his own speculations to make any further inquiries just then he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to sikes which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with fagin and after meditating for a long time concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker until another boy better suited for his purpose could be engaged fagin s eh exclaimed toby looking at oliver sikes invoking terrific imprecations upon fagin s head for sending oliver on such an errand plied the crowbar vigorously but with little noise fagin and company while these things were passing in the country workhouse mr fagin sat in the old den the same from which oliver had been removed by the girl brooding over a dull smoky fire matter fagin cried charley no more of it for me thank ee fagin replied mr what do you think he s thinking of fagin how should i know my dear replied the jew looking round as he plied the bellows see how he s a blushing oh my eye here s a merry go rounder tommy chitling s in love oh fagin fagin what a spree thoroughly overpowered with the notion of mr what i mean to say fagin replied mr but it turned out a good job for you didn t it fagin and what s six weeks of it it must come some time or another and why not in the winter time when you don t want to go out a walking so much eh fagin ah to be sure my dear replied the jew ah who ll say as much as that i should like to know eh fagin nobody my dear replied the jew not a soul tom i might have got clear off if i d split upon her mightn t i fagin angrily pursued the poor half witted dupe a word from me would have done it wouldn t it fagin to be sure it would my dear replied the jew but i didn t blab it did i fagin demanded tom pouring question upon question with great volubility a deal too stout my dear perhaps i was rejoined tom looking round and if i was what s to laugh at in that eh fagin the jew perceiving that mr after a short pause the dodger reappeared and whispered fagin mysteriously fagin would cure the hoptalmy said this respectable trader in acknowledgment of the jew s inquiry after his health the neighbourhood was a little too hot lively said fagin elevating his eyebrows and crossing his hands upon his shoulders well i ve heerd that complaint of it once or twice before replied the trader but it soon cools down again don t you find it so fagin nodded in the affirmative are you going up to the cripples fagin cried the little man calling after him merely making a sign to a man at the bar fagin walked straight upstairs and opening the door of a room and softly insinuating himself into the chamber looked anxiously about shading his eyes with his hand as if in search of some particular person as fagin stepped softly in the professional gentleman running over the keys by way of prelude occasioned a general cry of order for a song which having subsided a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through as loud as he could fagin troubled by no grave emotions looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search fagin inquired the man as he followed him out to the landing and no news of barney inquired fagin fagin crept softly upstairs and entered it without any previous ceremony what is it pursued fagin mad with rage did you mind me dear don t worry me now fagin replied the girl raising her head languidly fagin put several other questions all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints but she answered them so readily and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor was confirmed fagin who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time saw with great satisfaction that she was very far gone indeed fagin again turned his face homeward leaving his young friend asleep with her head upon the table fagin whispered a voice close to his ear fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour and indeed muttered something about having no fire but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner he unlocked the door and requested him to close it softly while he got a light make haste shut the door whispered fagin from the end of the passage fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there a listener might easily have perceived that fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation fagin i had no hand in it sending the plate which had so excited fagin s cupidity to the banker s and leaving giles and another servant in care of the house they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country and took oliver with them what s the matter here my dear said fagin looking in don t stand chattering and grinning at me with an exclamation of surprise fagin hastened to the girl s assistance while mr dawkins and you slap her hands fagin while bill undoes the petticuts why what evil wind has blowed you here he asked fagin fagin s request the artful untied this bundle which was of large size and formed of an old table cloth and handed the articles it contained one by one to charley bates who placed them on the table with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence ah said fagin rubbing his hands with great satisfaction what do you mean by leaving a man in this state three weeks and more you false hearted wagabond only hear him boys said fagin shrugging his shoulders don t be out of temper my dear urged fagin submissively there now bill remonstrated fagin eagerly catching at the word if it hadn t been for the girl who but poor ould fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you he says true enough there said nancy coming hastily forward nancy s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation for the boys receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew began to ply her with liquor of which however she took very sparingly while fagin assuming an unusual flow of spirits gradually brought mr lots cried fagin holding up is hands well well said fagin with a sigh i ll send the artful round presently after a great deal of haggling and squabbling fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen pence to keep house with mr in due course they arrived at fagin s abode where they found toby crackit and mr has nobody been toby asked fagin you ought to stand something handsome fagin to recompense me for keeping house so long am i fagin a very clever fellow my dear said fagin patting him on the shoulder and winking to his other pupils crackit is a heavy swell an t he fagin asked tom and it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance an t it fagin pursued tom but i can go and earn some more when i like can t i fagin to be sure you can and the sooner you go the better tom so make up your loss at once and don t lose any more time now said fagin when they had left the room i ll go and get you that cash nancy the jew turning round immediately afterwards she muttered a complaint of the heat in a tone of languor that contrasted very remarkably with the extreme haste and violence of this action which however had been unobserved by fagin who had his back towards her at the time only one of my young people said fagin observing that monks drew back on beholding a stranger the girl drew closer to the table and glancing at monks with an air of careless levity withdrew her eyes but as he turned towards fagin she stole another look so keen and searching and full of purpose that if there had been any bystander to observe the change he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person any news inquired fagin and and good asked fagin hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine fagin laughed and making some reply which did not reach her seemed by the creaking of the boards to lead his companion to the second story with a sigh for every piece of money fagin told the amount into her hand that she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon would have been obvious to the lynx eyed fagin who would most probably have taken the alarm at once but mr i am the girl that dragged little oliver back to old fagin s on the night he went out from the house in pentonville some time ago and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery i suspecting this man listened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own they laughed and talked of his success in doing this and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild said that though he had got the young devil s money safely now he d rather have had it the other way for what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father s will by driving him through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit of him besides in short fagin he says jew as you are you never laid such snares as i ll contrive for my young brother oliver the landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes and barney had only just returned from making the communication above related when fagin in the course of his evening s business came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest claypole kicking out his legs and continuing a conversation the commencement of which fagin had arrived too late to hear fagin a pleasant night sir but cool for the time of year said fagin rubbing his hands we have not so much dust as that in london replied fagin pointing from noah s shoes to those of his companion and from them to the two bundles fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger a gesture which noah attempted to imitate though not with complete success in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion and put about the liquor which barney reappeared with in a very friendly manner dear said fagin don t mind me my dear said fagin drawing his chair closer no matter who s got it or who did it my dear replied fagin glancing nevertheless with a hawk s eye at the girl and the two bundles in that way of business rejoined fagin and so are the people of the house i ll tell you more said fagin after he had reassured the girl by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements what advantage would it be to me to be anything else inquired fagin shrugging his shoulders quite perfect rejoined fagin clapping him on the shoulder now what do you think said fagin not a countryman among em and i don t think he d take you even on my recommendation if he didn t run rather short of assistants just now replied fagin it couldn t possibly be done without replied fagin in a most decided manner twenty pound though it s a lot of money not when it s in a note you can t get rid of retorted fagin fagin a little fancy work suggested fagin that s the sort of thing i heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others my dear said fagin what do you think of the old ladies asked fagin ain t there any other line open stop said fagin laying his hand on noah s knee the kinchins my dear said fagin is the young children that s sent on errands by their mothers with sixpences and shillings and the lay is just to take their money away they ve always got it ready in their hands then knock em into the kennel and walk off very slow as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself lord that s the very thing to be sure it is replied fagin and you can have a few good beats chalked out in camden town and battle bridge and neighborhoods like that where they re always going errands and you can upset as many kinchins as you want any hour in the day ha ha ha with this fagin poked mr what time to morrow shall we say will ten do asked fagin adding as mr bolter s humble servant said fagin bowing with grotesque politeness morris bolter late claypole turning to fagin you understand oh yes i understand perfectly replied fagin telling the truth for once fagin went his way claypole otherwise bolter when by virtue of the compact entered into between them he had removed next day to fagin s house cod i thought as much last night every man s his own friend my dear replied fagin with his most insinuating grin don t believe that said fagin in a little community like ours my dear said fagin who felt it necessary to qualify this position we have a general number one without considering me too as the same and all the other young people you see pursued fagin affecting to disregard this interruption we are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must be so no i don t retorted fagin only think said fagin shrugging his shoulders and stretching out his hands only consider the gallows continued fagin the gallows my dear is an ugly finger post which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow s career on the broad highway fagin saw with delight that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance it s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses said fagin no no replied fagin not so bad as that what i suppose he was wanted interposed fagin no replied fagin not very i m doubtful about it replied fagin with a sigh what s the good of talking in that way to me why don t yer speak so as i can understand yer fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue and being interpreted mr it s all up fagin said charley when he and his new companion had been made known to each other i must have a full suit of mourning fagin and a hatband to wisit him in afore he sets out upon his travels what do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for exclaimed fagin darting an angry look at his pupil then what do you talk of replied fagin angrily what are you blubbering for cause it isn t on the rec ord is it said charley chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets cause it can t come out in the dictment cause nobody will never know half of what he was oh my eye my eye wot a blow it is ha ha cried fagin extending his right hand and turning to mr bolter nodded assent and fagin after contemplating the grief of charley bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder never mind charley said fagin soothingly it ll come out it ll be sure to come out ay that he shall replied fagin and we ll have a big wig charley one that s got the greatest gift of the gab to carry on his defence and he shall make a speech for himself too if he likes and we ll read it all in the papers artful dodger shrieks of laughter here the court was convulsed eh charley eh ha ha laughed master bates what a lark that would be wouldn t it fagin i say how the artful would bother em wouldn t he would cried fagin i see it all afore me upon my soul i do fagin fagin had so well humoured his young friend s eccentric disposition that master bates who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the light of a victim now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities we must know how he gets on to day by some handy means or other said fagin not for the world replied fagin that wouldn t quite fit replied fagin shaking his head why if he didn t mind observed fagin what should he have to mind really nothing my dear said fagin turning to mr wot department has he got fagin inquired master bates surveying noah s lank form with much disgust master bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat that it was some time before fagin could interpose and represent to mr persuaded in part by these representations but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of fagin mr by fagin s directions he immediately substituted for his own attire a waggoner s frock velveteen breeches and leather leggings all of which articles the jew had at hand fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection fagin the animating news that the dodger was doing full justice to his bringing up and establishing for himself a glorious reputation vile as those schemes were desperate as were their originators and bitter as were her feelings towards fagin who had led her step by step deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery whence was no escape still there were times when even towards him she felt some relenting lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded and he should fall at last richly as he merited such a fate by her hand ah replied fagin fagin sighed and shook his head despondingly that s the way to talk my dear replied fagin venturing to pat him on the shoulder ha ha ha laughed fagin as if he were relieved by even this concession it make you nervous bill reminds you of being nabbed does it said fagin determined not to be offended fagin offered no reply to this compliment but pulling sikes by the sleeve pointed his finger towards nancy who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet and was now leaving the room what do you mean bill do you know what you re doing know what i m oh cried sikes turning to fagin she s out of her senses you know or she daren t talk to me in that way tell him to let me go fagin with a caution backed by many oaths to make no more efforts to go out that night sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined fagin wot a precious strange gal that is you may say that bill replied fagin thoughtfully worse said fagin thoughtfully fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then and in a few minutes the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour whispering sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing fagin took up his hat and bade him good night the reason of all this replied fagin if he he pointed with his skinny fore finger up the stairs is so hard with you he s a brute nance a brute beast why don t you well said the girl as fagin paused with his mouth almost touching her ear and his eyes looking into hers she shrank back as fagin offered to lay his hand on hers but said good night again in a steady voice and answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence closed the door between them fagin walked towards his home intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain he would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as nancy and must thus fagin argued be secured without delay sikes knew too much and his ruffian taunts had not galled fagin the less because the wounds were hidden with a little persuasion thought fagin what more likely than that she would consent to poison him women have done such things and worse to secure the same object before now these things passed through the mind of fagin during the short time he sat alone in the housebreaker s room and with them uppermost in his thoughts he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting how thought fagin as he crept homeward can i increase my influence with her what new power can i acquire such brains are fertile in expedients if without extracting a confession from herself he laid a watch discovered the object of her altered regard and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes of whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs could he not secure her compliance i can said fagin almost aloud chapter xlv noah claypole is employed by fagin on a secret mission the old man was up betimes next morning and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate who after a delay that seemed interminable at length presented himself and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast bolter said fagin drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite morris bolter you can talk as you eat can t you said fagin cursing his dear young friend s greediness from the very bottom of his heart where s charlotte out said fagin you did well yesterday my dear said fagin eh ha ha ha fagin affected to laugh very heartily and mr i want you bolter said fagin leaning over the table to do a piece of work for me my dear that needs great care and caution a young one replied fagin one pound said fagin

fagin elated by the success of his proposal i ll point her out at the proper time said fagin that night and the next and the next again the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter s dress ready to turn out at a word from fagin six nights passed six long weary nights and on each fagin came home with a disappointed face and briefly intimated that it was not yet time she goes abroad to night said fagin and on the right errand i m sure for she has been alone all day and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak it opened softly on its hinges as fagin gave a low whistle scarcely venturing to whisper but substituting dumb show for words fagin and the young jew who had admitted them pointed out the pane of glass to noah and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room fagin nodded yes stay there whispered fagin fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment and emerged by the door at which they had entered noah exchanged a look with fagin and darted out fagin cried the girl recoiling then pursued the gentleman this fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent chapter xlvii fatal consequences it was nearly two hours before day break that time which in the autumn of the year may be truly called the dead of night when the streets are silent and deserted when even sounds appear to slumber and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream it was at this still and silent hour that fagin sat watching in his old lair with face so distorted and pale and eyes so red and blood shot that he looked less like a man than like some hideous phantom moist from the grave and worried by an evil spirit mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes the fear of detection and ruin and death and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all these were the passionate considerations which following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain of fagin as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart fagin laid his hand upon the bundle and locking it in the cupboard sat down again without speaking wot do you look at a man so for fagin raised his right hand and shook his trembling forefinger in the air but his passion was so great that the power of speech was for the moment gone no no rejoined fagin finding his voice i ve got that to tell you bill said fagin drawing his chair nearer will make you worse than me lost cried fagin out with it you thundering old cur out with it suppose that lad that s laying there fagin began suppose that lad pursued fagin was to peach to blow upon us all first seeking out the right folks for the purpose and then having a meeting with em in the street to paint our likenesses describe every mark that they might know us by and the crib where we might be most easily taken what if i did it cried fagin almost in a yell fagin looked hard at the robber and motioning him to be silent stooped over the bed upon the floor and shook the sleeper to rouse him bolter bolter poor lad said fagin looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis fagin made no answer but bending over the sleeper again hauled him into a sitting posture that about nancy said fagin clutching sikes by the wrist as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough she told it all every word without a threat without a murmur she did did she not cried fagin half mad with fury tell it again cried fagin tightening his grasp on sikes and brandishing his other hand aloft as the foam flew from his lips what more of him cried fagin bill bill cried fagin following him hastily let me out i say hear me speak a word rejoined fagin laying his hand upon the lock i mean said fagin showing that he felt all disguise was now useless not too violent for safety sikes made no reply but pulling open the door of which fagin had turned the lock dashed into the silent streets why can t i lie by for a week or so and forcing blunt from fagin get abroad to france damme i ll risk it fagin said mr there was a short silence after which toby crackit seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil may care swagger turned to chitling and said when was fagin took then just at dinner time two o clock this afternoon the sessions are on said kags if they get the inquest over and bolter turns king s evidence as of course he will from what he s said already they can prove fagin an accessory before the fact and get the trial on on friday and he ll swing in six days from this by g you should have heard the people groan said chitling the officers fought like devils or they d have torn him away to night s paper says that fagin s took brownlow and a man whom oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see for they told him it was his brother and it was the same man he had met at the market town and seen looking in with fagin at the window of his little room poor dick was dead chapter lii fagin s last night alive the court was paved from floor to roof with human faces from the rail before the dock away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries all looks were fixed upon one man fagin take him away to bed cried fagin saw his head off fagin said the jailer fagin fagin are you a man i shan t be one long he replied looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror it s all a lie together replied fagin where are those papers oliver cried fagin beckoning to him the papers said fagin drawing oliver towards him are in a canvas bag in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front room outside outside replied fagin pushing the boy before him towards the door and looking vacantly over his head that s right that s right said fagin press on press on cried fagin as far from home died the chief remaining members of his friend fagin s gang noah claypole receiving a free pardon from the crown in consequence of being admitted approver against fagin and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish was for some little time at a loss for the means of a livelihood not burdened with too much work marley s ghost marley was dead to begin with old marley was as dead as a door nail you will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that marley was as dead as a door nail the mention of marley s funeral brings me back to the point i started from there is no doubt that marley was dead scrooge never painted out old marley s name there it stood years afterwards above the warehouse door scrooge and marley the firm was known as scrooge and marley sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names scrooge and marley s i believe said one of the gentlemen referring to his list marley mr marley has been dead these seven years scrooge replied let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon and then let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate process of change not a knocker but marley s face marley s face it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge as marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead he did pause with a moment s irresolution before he shut the door and he did look cautiously behind it first as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of marley s pigtail sticking out into the hall there were cains and abels pharaoh s daughters queens of sheba angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather beds abrahams belshazzars apostles putting off to sea in butter boats hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts and yet that face of marley seven years dead came like the ancient prophet s rod and swallowed up the whole if each smooth tile had been a blank at first with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would have been a copy of old marley s head on every one upon its coming in the dying flame leaped up as though it cried i know him marley s ghost and fell again marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his coat skirts and the hair upon his head scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no bowels but he had never believed it until now what do you want with me much marley s voice no doubt about it in life i was your partner jacob marley old jacob marley tell me more speak comfort to me jacob i have none to give the ghost replied when they were within two paces of each other marley s ghost held up its hand warning him to come no nearer every one of them wore chains like marley s ghost some few they might be guilty governments were linked together none were free marley s ghost bothered him exceedingly he felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through jacob marley s intervention the crisp leaves of holly mistletoe and ivy reflected back the light as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in scrooge s time or marley s or for many and many a winter season gone when this strain of music sounded all the things that ghost had shown him came upon his mind he softened more and more and thought that if he could have listened to it often years ago he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands without resorting to the sexton s spade that buried jacob marley as the last stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the prediction of old jacob marley and lifting up his eyes beheld a solemn phantom draped and hooded coming like a mist along the ground towards him o jacob marley heaven and the christmas time be praised for this i say it on my knees old jacob on my knees he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call there s the door by which the ghost of jacob marley entered there s the corner where the ghost of christmas present sat there s the window where i saw the wandering spirits it s all right it s all true it all happened he had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his counting house the day before and said scrooge and marley s i believe it sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met but he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it madame defarge his wife sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything a large hand heavily ringed a steady face strong features and great composure of manner there was a character about madame defarge from which one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided madame defarge being sensitive to cold was wrapped in fur and had a quantity of bright shawl twined about her head though not to the concealment of her large earrings thus engaged with her right elbow supported by her left hand madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in but coughed just one grain of cough what the devil do you do in that galley there said monsieur defarge to himself i don t know you how goes it jacques said one of these three to monsieur defarge is all the spilt wine swallowed every drop jacques answered monsieur defarge when this interchange of christian name was effected madame defarge picking her teeth with her toothpick coughed another grain of cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line it is not often said the second of the three addressing monsieur defarge that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine or of anything but black bread and death is it not so jacques it is so jacques monsieur defarge returned at this second interchange of the christian name madame defarge still using her toothpick with profound composure coughed another grain of cough and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line am i right jacques you are right jacques was the response of monsieur defarge this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment when madame defarge put her toothpick by kept her eyebrows up and slightly rustled in her seat gentlemen my wife the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge with three flourishes the eyes of monsieur defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner and begged the favour of a word willingly sir said monsieur defarge and quietly stepped with him to the door almost at the first word monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive madame defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows and saw nothing jarvis lorry and miss manette emerging from the wine shop thus joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before in the gloomy tile paved entry to the gloomy tile paved staircase monsieur defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master and put her hand to his lips thus monsieur defarge in a stern voice to mr yes was the grim reply of monsieur defarge monsieur defarge whispered it closer in his ear and frowned heavily is it possible repeated defarge bitterly that s well friend defarge i forgot them in the surprise of your visit explained monsieur defarge defarge drew out the key closed the door locked it on the inside took out the key again and held it in his hand the shoemaker good day said monsieur defarge looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking i want said defarge who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker to let in a little more light here are you going to finish that pair of shoes to day asked defarge motioning to mr when he had stood for a minute or two by the side of defarge the shoemaker looked up you have a visitor you see said monsieur defarge come said defarge and the maker s name said defarge his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him but as no help came from that quarter they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground lorry laid his hand upon defarge s arm do you remember nothing of this man look at him lorry and at defarge some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him have you recognised him monsieur asked defarge in a whisper it is true said defarge who was kneeling to look on and hear lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this course and in favour of one of them remaining lorry and monsieur defarge had made all ready for the journey and had brought with them besides travelling cloaks and wrappers bread and meat wine and hot coffee monsieur defarge put this provender and the lamp he carried on the shoemaker s bench there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed and he and mr they began to descend monsieur defarge going first with the lamp mr only one soul was to be seen and that was madame defarge who leaned against the door post knitting and saw nothing madame defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them and went knitting out of the lamplight through the courtyard defarge got upon the box and gave the word to the barrier the postilion cracked his whip and they clattered away under the feeble over swinging lamps your papers travellers see here then monsieur the officer said defarge getting down and taking him gravely apart these are the papers of monsieur inside with the white head adieu from defarge how do they call you they call me defarge hold the horses who threw that he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stood a moment before but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman knitting knitting there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine shop of monsieur defarge monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time no vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of monsieur defarge but a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark lay hidden in the dregs of it this had been the third morning in succession on which there had been early drinking at the wine shop of monsieur defarge he was not missed for nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him nobody asked for him nobody wondered to see only madame defarge in her seat presiding over the distribution of wine with a bowl of battered small coins before her as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come games at cards languished players at dominoes musingly built towers with them drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine madame defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off it was high noontide when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps of whom one was monsieur defarge the other a mender of roads in a blue cap good day gentlemen said monsieur defarge it elicited an answering chorus of good day it is bad weather gentlemen said defarge shaking his head my wife said defarge aloud addressing madame defarge i have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads called jacques madame defarge set wine before the mender of roads called jacques who doffed his blue cap to the company and drank in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread he ate of this between whiles and sat munching and drinking near madame defarge s counter defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine but he took less than was given to the stranger as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast he looked at no one present and no one now looked at him not even madame defarge who had taken up her knitting and was at work defarge closed the door carefully and spoke in a subdued voice jacques one jacques two jacques three this is the witness encountered by appointment by me jacques four speak jacques five the mender of roads blue cap in hand wiped his swarthy forehead with it and said where shall i commence monsieur commence was monsieur defarge s not unreasonable reply at the commencement he is right there jacques murmured defarge to him who had interrupted the tall man is lost and he is sought how many months nine ten eleven no matter the number said defarge observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again defarge said go on jacques defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another they had the air of a rough tribunal jacques one and two sitting on the old pallet bed each with his chin resting on his hand and his eyes intent on the road mender jacques three equally intent on one knee behind them with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose defarge standing between them and the narrator whom he had stationed in the light of the window by turns looking from him to them and from them to him go on jacques said defarge it is defarge whom you see here who at the hazard of his life darted out before the horses with the petition in his hand go on then said defarge enough said defarge with grim impatience whom defarge escorted to the top of the stairs and leaving seated there returned to be registered to be registered as doomed to destruction returned defarge the chateau and all the race returned defarge are you sure asked jacques two of defarge that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register without doubt it is safe for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it but shall we always be able to decipher it or i ought to say will she jacques returned defarge drawing himself up if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone she would not lose a word of it not a syllable of it confide in madame defarge it would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives to erase himself from existence than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge he is very simple is he not a little dangerous he knows nothing said defarge at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height is it a good sign that he wishes to see royalty and nobility jacques said defarge judiciously show a cat milk if you wish her to thirst for it worse quarters than defarge s wine shop could easily have been found in paris for a provincial slave of that degree yes answered madame defarge i have a good deal to do for instance for instance returned madame defarge composedly shrouds during the whole of this scene which lasted some three hours he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company and throughout defarge held him by the collar as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces bravo said defarge clapping him on the back when it was over like a patron you are a good boy the mender of roads was now coming to himself and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations but no you are the fellow we want said defarge in his ear you make these fools believe that it will last for ever madame defarge looked superciliously at the client and nodded in confirmation you have seen both dolls and birds to day said madame defarge with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent now go home xvi still knitting madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of saint antoine while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness and through the dust and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of monsieur the marquis now in his grave listened to the whispering trees the defarges husband and wife came lumbering under the starlight in their public vehicle to that gate of paris whereunto their journey naturally tended monsieur defarge alighted knowing one or two of the soldiery there and one of the police when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his dusky wings and they having finally alighted near the saint s boundaries were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets madame defarge spoke to her husband say then my friend what did jacques of the police tell thee very little to night but all he knows eh well said madame defarge raising her eyebrows with a cool business air his name barsad said defarge making it french by pronunciation they turned into the wine shop which was closed for it was midnight and where madame defarge immediately took her post at her desk counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence examined the stock went through the entries in the book made other entries of her own checked the serving man in every possible way and finally dismissed him to bed all this while defarge with his pipe in his mouth walked up and down complacently admiring but never interfering in which condition indeed as to the business and his domestic affairs he walked up and down through life monsieur defarge s olfactory sense was by no means delicate but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed oh the men the men but my dear began defarge but my dear repeated madame nodding firmly but my dear you are faint of heart to night my dear well then said defarge as if a thought were wrung out of his breast it is a long time it does not take a long time to strike a man with lightning said defarge defarge raised his head thoughtfully as if there were something in that too eh well tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake a long time i suppose said defarge my brave wife returned defarge standing before her with his head a little bent and his hands clasped at his back like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist i do not question all this well said defarge with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug hold cried defarge reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice i too my dear will stop at nothing a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she felt to be a new one the moment madame defarge took up the rose the customers ceased talking and began gradually to drop out of the wine shop marvellous cognac this madame it was the first time it had ever been so complimented and madame defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better if i do well said madame drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry i ll use it it was remarkable but the taste of saint antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head dress of madame defarge the spy who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face but stood with an air of gossiping gallantry leaning his elbow on madame defarge s little counter and occasionally sipping his cognac is there not here is my husband said madame defarge as the keeper of the wine shop entered at the door the spy saluted him by touching his hat and saying with an engaging smile good day jacques defarge stopped short and stared at him i am ernest defarge it is all the same said the spy airily but discomfited too good day good day answered defarge drily no one has told me so said defarge shaking his head madame defarge poured it out for him took to her knitting again and hummed a little song over it you seem to know this quarter well that is to say better than i do observed defarge hah muttered defarge the pleasure of conversing with you monsieur defarge recalls to me pursued the spy that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting associations with your name indeed said defarge with much indifference you see i am informed of the circumstances such is the fact certainly said defarge such is the fact repeated defarge yes said defarge no said defarge madame defarge knitted steadily but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband barsad paid for what he had drunk and took his leave taking occasion to say in a genteel manner before he departed that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again can it be true said defarge in a low voice looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair what he has said of ma amselle manette as he has said it returned madame lifting her eyebrows a little it is probably false if it is defarge began and stopped her husband s destiny said madame defarge with her usual composure will take him where he is to go and will lead him to the end that is to end him but it is very strange now at least is it not very strange said defarge rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it that after all our sympathy for monsieur her father and herself her husband s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment by the side of that infernal dog s who has just left us stranger things than that will happen when it does come answered madame in the evening at which season of all others saint antoine turned himself inside out and sat on door steps and window ledges and came to the corners of vile streets and courts for a breath of air madame defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group a missionary there were many like her such as the world will do well never to breed again and as madame defarge moved on from group to group all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with and left behind lorry was reminded of defarge the wine shop keeper and the starlight ride as a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point so all this raging circled round defarge s wine shop and every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where defarge himself already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat issued orders issued arms thrust this man back dragged this man forward disarmed one to arm another laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar keep near to me jacques three cried defarge and do you jacques one and two separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can come then cried defarge in a resounding voice through the fire and through the smoke in the fire and in the smoke for the sea cast him up against a cannon and on the instant he became a cannonier defarge of the wine shop worked like a manful soldier two fierce hours one drawbridge down work comrades all work work jacques one jacques two jacques one thousand jacques two thousand jacques five and twenty thousand in the name of all the angels or the devils which you prefer work thus defarge of the wine shop still at his gun which had long grown hot flashing weapons blazing torches smoking waggonloads of wet straw hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions shrieks volleys execrations bravery without stint boom smash and rattle and the furious sounding of the living sea but still the deep ditch and the single drawbridge and the massive stone walls and the eight great towers and still defarge of the wine shop at his gun grown doubly hot by the service of four fierce hours a white flag from within the fortress and a parley this dimly perceptible through the raging storm nothing audible in it suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher and swept defarge of the wine shop over the lowered drawbridge past the massive stone outer walls in among the eight great towers surrendered so resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the south sea until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the bastille jacques three was nearly at his side madame defarge still heading some of her women was visible in the inner distance and her knife was in her hand when the foremost billows rolled past bearing the prison officers with them and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men a man with a grey head who had a lighted torch in his hand separated him from the rest and got him between himself and the wall show me the north tower said defarge what is the meaning of one hundred and five north tower asked defarge jacques three with his usual craving on him and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed held by defarge s arm as he held by the turnkey s through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone past hideous doors of dark dens and cages down cavernous flights of steps and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick more like dry waterfalls than staircases defarge the turnkey and jacques three linked hand and arm went with all the speed they could make pass that torch slowly along these walls that i may see them said defarge to the turnkey the man obeyed and defarge followed the light closely with his eyes alexandre manette said defarge in his ear following the letters with his swart forefinger deeply engrained with gunpowder they found it surging and tossing in quest of defarge himself see defarge she stood immovable close to the grim old officer and remained immovable close to him remained immovable close to him through the streets as defarge and the rest bore him along remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination and began to be struck at from behind remained immovable close to him when the long gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy was so close to him when he dropped dead under it that suddenly animated she put her foot upon his neck and with her cruel knife long ready hewed off his head saint antoine s blood was up and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down down on the steps of the hotel de ville where the governor s body lay down on the sole of the shoe of madame defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation now heaven defeat the fancy of lucie darnay and keep these feet far out of her life for they are headlong mad and dangerous and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at defarge s wine shop door they are not easily purified when once stained red the sea still rises haggard saint antoine had had only one exultant week in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations when madame defarge sat at her counter as usual presiding over the customers madame defarge wore no rose in her head for the great brotherhood of spies had become even in one short week extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint s mercies madame defarge with her arms folded sat in the morning light and heat contemplating the wine shop and the street madame defarge sat observing it with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women it is defarge said madame silence patriots defarge came in breathless pulled off a red cap he wore and looked around him listen everywhere said madame again listen to him defarge stood panting against a background of eager eyes and open mouths formed outside the door all those within the wine shop had sprung to their feet defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another patriots said defarge in a determined voice are we ready instantly madame defarge s knife was in her girdle the drum was beating in the streets as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic and the vengeance uttering terrific shrieks and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty furies at once was tearing from house to house rousing the women the defarges husband and wife the vengeance and jacques three were in the first press and at no great distance from him in the hall the people immediately behind madame defarge explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them and those again explaining to others and those to others the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of hands similarly during two or three hours of drawl and the winnowing of many bushels of words madame defarge s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up with marvellous quickness at a distance the more readily because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows knew madame defarge well and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace madame defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied the vengeance and jacques three were not yet up with them and the men at the windows had not yet swooped into the hall like birds of prey from their high perches when the cry seemed to go up all over the city bring him out bring him to the lamp down and up and head foremost on the steps of the building now on his knees now on his feet now on his back dragged and struck at and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands torn bruised panting bleeding yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy now full of vehement agony of action with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see now a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung and there madame defarge let him go as a cat might have done to a mouse and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready and while he besought her the women passionately screeching at him all the time and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth it was almost morning when defarge s wine shop parted with its last knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door at last it is come my dear eh well returned madame saint antoine slept the defarges slept even the vengeance slept with her starved grocer and the drum was at rest citizen defarge said he to darnay s conductor as he took a slip of paper to write on the officer wrote until he had finished read over to himself what he had written sanded it and handed it to defarge with the words in secret defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him is it you said defarge in a low voice as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into paris who married the daughter of doctor manette once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more yes replied darnay looking at him with surprise my name is defarge and i keep a wine shop in the quarter saint antoine my wife came to your house to reclaim her father yes the word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defarge to say with sudden impatience in the name of that sharp female newly born and called la guillotine why did you come to france you heard me say why a minute ago do you not believe it is the truth a bad truth for you said defarge speaking with knitted brows and looking straight before him defarge spoke always looking straight before him but never by me citizen defarge defarge glanced darkly at him for answer and walked on in a steady and set silence will you cause that to be done for me i will do defarge doggedly rejoined nothing for you a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket to whom defarge presented the emigrant evremonde defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation and withdrew with his two fellow patriots at first his mind reverted to defarge and he thought of finding out the wine shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling place in the distracted state of the city and what says he what does he send me defarge gave into his anxious hand an open scrap of paper lorry joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud to where his wife resides yes returned defarge scarcely noticing as yet in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way defarge spoke mr madame defarge surely said mr beginning to be struck by defarge s manner mr it was so much however to her who received it that she turned from defarge to his wife and kissed one of the hands that knitted she stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom and with her hands yet at her neck looked terrified at madame defarge madame defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold impassive stare lorry striking in to explain there are frequent risings in the streets and although it is not likely they will ever trouble you madame defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times to the end that she may know them that she may identify them lorry rather halting in his reassuring words as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more i state the case citizen defarge defarge looked gloomily at his wife and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence our good pross defarge is an english lady and knows no french the lady in question whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner was not to be shaken by distress and danger appeared with folded arms and observed in english to the vengeance whom her eyes first encountered well i am sure boldface i hope you are pretty well she also bestowed a british cough on madame defarge but neither of the two took much heed of her is that his child said madame defarge stopping in her work for the first time and pointing her knitting needle at little lucie as if it were the finger of fate the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her and held her to her breast the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed then to fall threatening and dark on both the mother and the child it is enough my husband said madame defarge but the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it not visible and presented but indistinct and withheld to alarm lucie into saying as she laid her appealing hand on madame defarge s dress you will be good to my poor husband you will help me to see him if you can your husband is not my business here returned madame defarge looking down at her with perfect composure madame defarge received it as a compliment and looked at her husband defarge who had been uneasily biting his thumb nail and looking at her collected his face into a sterner expression what is it that your husband says in that little letter asked madame defarge with a lowering smile surely it will release him said madame defarge as a wife and mother madame defarge looked coldly as ever at the suppliant and said turning to her friend the vengeance the wives and mothers we have been used to see since we were as little as this child and much less have not been greatly considered we have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them often enough all our lives we have seen our sister women suffer in themselves and in their children poverty nakedness hunger thirst sickness misery oppression and neglect of all kinds we have seen nothing else returned the vengeance we have borne this a long time said madame defarge turning her eyes again upon lucie defarge went last and closed the door but the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark upon himself for all that and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly that presented by his conductors to this tribunal he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the bastille that one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him and that this man was defarge madame defarge madame defarge gone like a shadow over the white road she was in a front row by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier but whom he directly remembered as defarge but he is denounced and gravely by the citizen and citizeness defarge he knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint antoine and defarge s wine shop had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning doctor manette s imprisonment release and history as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the defarges and tried them on madame defarge and had broken down with them signally ernest defarge wine vendor of st therese defarge his wife defarge was produced when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment and of his having been a mere boy in the doctor s service and of the release and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him i knew said defarge looking down at his wife who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised looking steadily up at him i knew that this prisoner of whom i speak had been confined in a cell known as one hundred and five north tower in a dead silence and stillness the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader madame defarge never taking hers from the prisoner defarge never taking his from his feasting wife and all the other eyes there intent upon the doctor who saw none of them the paper was read as follows that night the last night of the year towards nine o clock a man in a black dress rang at my gate demanded to see me and softly followed my servant ernest defarge a youth up stairs little need in presence of that tribunal and that auditory to show how the defarges had not made the paper public with the other captured bastille memorials borne in procession and had kept it biding their time much influence around him has that doctor murmured madame defarge smiling to the vengeance defarge had described himself that day as the keeper of a wine shop in the saint antoine suburb this done he went on direct to defarge s and went in this man whom he had seen upon the jury stood drinking at the little counter in conversation with the defarges man and wife as carton walked in took his seat and asked in very indifferent french for a small measure of wine madame defarge cast a careless glance at him and then a keener and then a keener and then advanced to him herself and asked him what it was he had ordered english asked madame defarge inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows i am english madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine and as he took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning he heard her say i swear to you like evremonde defarge brought him the wine and gave him good evening defarge went back to the counter and said certainly a little like why stop well well reasoned defarge but one must stop somewhere extermination is good doctrine my wife said defarge rather troubled in general i say nothing against it let him take care of his face and you have observed my wife said defarge in a deprecatory manner the anguish of his daughter which must be a dreadful anguish to him i have observed his daughter repeated madame yes i have observed his daughter more times than one no protested defarge see you then jacques said madame defarge wrathfully and see you too my little vengeance see you both listen for other crimes as tyrants and oppressors i have this race a long time on my register doomed to destruction and extermination it is so assented defarge without being asked it is so assented defarge it is so assented defarge again i smite this bosom with these two hands as i smite it now and i tell him defarge i was brought up among the fishermen of the sea shore and that peasant family so injured by the two evremonde brothers as that bastille paper describes is my family defarge that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister that husband was my sister s husband that unborn child was their child that brother was my brother that father was my father those dead are my dead and that summons to answer for those things descends to me ask him is that so it is so assented defarge once more defarge a weak minority interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply madame defarge took him to the door and put her arm on his in pointing out the road lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping they are in danger of denunciation by madame defarge he knows that a wood sawyer living by the prison wall is under the control of the defarges and has been rehearsed by madame defarge as to his having seen her he never mentioned lucie s name making signs and signals to prisoners the knitting done in that same juncture of time when the fifty two awaited their fate madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and jacques three of the revolutionary jury not in the wine shop did madame defarge confer with these ministers but in the shed of the wood sawyer erst a mender of roads but our defarge said jacques three is undoubtedly a good republican eh there is no better the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill notes in france peace little vengeance said madame defarge laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant s lips hear me speak madame defarge cast down her eyes and reflected a little it is a pretty sight in a word said madame defarge coming out of her short abstraction i cannot trust my husband in this matter in a word madame defarge went on my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation and i have not his reason for regarding this doctor with any sensibility touching those signals little citizen said madame defarge sternly that she made to the prisoners you are ready to bear witness to them this very day ay ay why not cried the sawyer transparently there is no doubt of the jury inquired madame defarge letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile now let me see said madame defarge pondering again he was signalling with her when i saw her argued madame defarge i cannot speak of one without the other and i must not be silent and trust the case wholly to him this little citizen here he must take his chance said madame defarge he was so very demonstrative herein that he might have been suspected perhaps was by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of madame defarge s head of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety every hour in the day madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to the door and there expounded her further views to them thus she will now be at home awaiting the moment of his death take you my knitting said madame defarge placing it in her lieutenant s hands and have it ready for me in my usual seat be sure you are there my soul said the vengeance calling after her for she had already turned into the street before the tumbrils arrive madame defarge slightly waved her hand to imply that she heard and might be relied upon to arrive in good time and so went through the mud and round the corner of the prison wall such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe thus accoutred and walking with the confident tread of such a character and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood bare foot and bare legged on the brown sea sand madame defarge took her way along the streets she and jerry had beheld the coach start had known who it was that solomon brought had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach even as madame defarge taking her way through the streets now drew nearer and nearer to the else deserted lodging in which they held their consultation and still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came nearer and nearer cruncher let us think still madame defarge pursuing her way along the streets came nearer and nearer alas temple bar was hundreds of miles away and madame defarge was drawing very near indeed the basin fell to the ground broken and the water flowed to the feet of madame defarge madame defarge looked coldly at her and said the wife of evremonde where is she it flashed upon miss pross s mind that the doors were all standing open and would suggest the flight madame defarge s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement and rested on her when it was finished miss pross had nothing beautiful about her years had not tamed the wildness or softened the grimness of her appearance but she too was a determined woman in her different way and she measured madame defarge with her eyes every inch madame defarge looked at her scornfully but still with something of miss pross s own perception that they two were at bay she knew full well that miss pross was the family s devoted friend miss pross knew full well that madame defarge was the family s malevolent enemy on my way yonder said madame defarge with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me i am come to make my compliments to her in passing it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment said madame defarge madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail but she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught woman imbecile and pig like said madame defarge frowning madame defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross first became aware of her but she now advanced one step this was a courage that madame defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness then she raised her voice and called out citizen doctor wife of evremonde child of evremonde any person but this miserable fool answer the citizeness defarge perhaps the following silence perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of miss pross s face perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion whispered to madame defarge that they were gone never said miss pross who understood the request as perfectly as madame defarge understood the answer if they are not in that room they are gone and can be pursued and brought back said madame defarge to herself i have been in the streets from the first nothing has stopped me i will tear you to pieces but i will have you from that door said madame defarge madame defarge made at the door it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike miss pross with the vigorous tenacity of love always so much stronger than hate clasped her tight and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her face but miss pross with her head down held her round the waist and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman soon madame defarge s hands ceased to strike and felt at her encircled waist i hold you till one or other of us faints or dies madame defarge s hands were at her bosom who has seen her therese defarge she never missed before says a knitting woman of the sisterhood if he had given any utterance to his and they were prophetic they would have been these i see barsad and cly defarge the vengeance the juryman the judge long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old perishing by this retributive instrument before it shall cease out of its present use sikes said the jew trembling don t speak so loud none of your mistering replied the ruffian you always mean mischief when you come that well well then bill sikes said the jew with abject humility perhaps i am replied sikes i should think you was rather out of sorts too unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about as you do when you blab and are you mad said the jew catching the man by the sleeve and pointing towards the boys sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear and jerking his head over on the right shoulder a piece of dumb show which the jew appeared to understand perfectly sikes laying his hat upon the table sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen which gracious act led to a conversation in which the cause and manner of oliver s capture were circumstantially detailed with such alterations and improvements on the truth as to the dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances that s very likely returned sikes with a malicious grin sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in sikes and then he must be taken care on william sikes happened one and all to entertain a violent and deeply rooted antipathy to going near a police office on any ground or pretext whatever sikes looking up in a surly manner sikes nobody about here knows anything of you she ll go fagin said sikes yes she will fagin said sikes sikes was right give her a door key to carry in her t other one fagin said sikes it looks real and genivine like sikes filling his glass and smiting the table with his enormous fist bill sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered than he very hastily called up the white dog and putting on his hat expeditiously departed without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good morning william sikes sikes suddenly breaking silence sikes s dog having faults of temper in common with his owner and labouring perhaps at this moment under a powerful sense of injury made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half boots sikes levelled at his head you would would you said sikes seizing the poker in one hand and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp knife which he drew from his pocket sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice but appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut he remained where he was and growled more fiercely than before at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth and biting at it like a wild beast sikes the more who dropping on his knees began to assail the animal most furiously the dog jumped from right to left and from left to right snapping growling and barking the man thrust and swore and struck and blasphemed and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other when the door suddenly opening the dog darted out leaving bill sikes with the poker and the clasp knife in his hands sikes being disappointed of the dog s participation at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer what the devil do you come in between me and my dog for said sikes with a fierce gesture didn t know you white livered thief growled sikes oh no you hear nothing you don t retorted sikes with a fierce sneer cause the government as cares for the lives of such men as you as haven t half the pluck of curs lets a man kill a dog how he likes replied sikes shutting up the knife with a very expressive look that s why grin away said sikes replacing the poker and surveying him with savage contempt grin away humph said sikes as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the jew s side than on his sikes snatching it from him hastily opened it and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained this is all is it inquired sikes you haven t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along have you inquired sikes suspiciously bill sikes merely pointed to the empty measure it was lost upon sikes who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot lace which the dog had torn is anybody here barney inquired fagin speaking now that that sikes was looking on without raising his eyes from the ground nancy exclaimed sikes send her here said sikes pouring out a glass of liquor you are on the scent are you nancy inquired sikes proffering the glass sikes turned the conversation to other matters sikes finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself expressed his intention of accompanying her they went away together followed at a little distant by the dog who slunk out of a back yard as soon as his master was out of sight the jew thrust his head out of the room door when sikes had left it looked after him as he walked up the dark passage shook his clenched fist muttered a deep curse and then with a horrible grin reseated himself at the table where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the hue and cry sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot the girl being quite unable to support any longer the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked do you hear growled sikes as oliver hesitated and looked round give me the other said sikes seizing oliver s unoccupied hand see here boy said sikes putting his other hand to oliver s throat if he speaks ever so soft a word hold him d ye mind the dog growled again and licking his lips eyed oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay he s as willing as a christian strike me blind if he isn t said sikes regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval what s the good of telling me that i can hear it can t i replied sikes of course they can replied sikes oh bill such fine young chaps as them yes that s all you women think of answered sikes sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy and clasping oliver s wrist more firmly told him to step out again sikes sikes himself all right cried sikes glancing cautiously about sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony and all three were quickly inside the house anybody here inquired sikes let s have a glim said sikes or we shall go breaking our necks or treading on the dog hallo what s that inquired sikes stepping forward as the jew seized the note if that ain t mine said bill sikes putting on his hat with a determined air mine and nancy s that is i ll take the boy back again come hand over will you said sikes fair or not fair retorted sikes hand over i tell you do you think nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping every young boy as gets grabbed through you give it here you avaricious old skeleton give it here with this gentle remonstrance mr sikes plucked the note from between the jew s finger and thumb and looking the old man coolly in the face folded it up small and tied it in his neckerchief that s for our share of the trouble said sikes and not half enough neither ha ha chuckled the jew rubbing his hands it couldn t have happened better if we had chosen our time of course it couldn t replied sikes i know d that directly i see him coming through clerkenwell with the books under his arm oliver had looked from one to the other while these words were being spoken as if he were bewildered and could scarecely understand what passed but when bill sikes concluded he jumped suddenly to his feet and tore wildly from the room uttering shrieks for help which made the bare old house echo to the roof serve him right cried sikes struggling to disengage himself from the girl s grasp shan t he said sikes setting his teeth the girl s gone mad i think replied sikes savagely sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner you you re more clever than ever to night the jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of miss nancy s rage and shrinking involuntarily back a few paces cast a glance half imploring and half cowardly at sikes as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue sikes thus mutely appealed to and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of miss nancy to reason gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention what do you mean by this said sikes backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features which if it were heard above only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below would render blindness as common a disorder as measles what do you mean by it burn my body do you know who you are and what you are oh yes i know all about it replied the girl laughing hysterically and shaking her head from side to side with a poor assumption of indifference well then keep quiet rejoined sikes with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog or i ll quiet you for a good long time to come the girl laughed again even less composedly than before and darting a hasty look at sikes turned her face aside and bit her lip till the blood came you re a nice one added sikes as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air to take up the humane and gen teel side a pretty subject for the child as you call him to make a friend of god almighty help me i am cried the girl passionately and i wish i had been struck dead in the street or had changed places with them we passed so near to night before i had lent a hand in bringing him here isn t that enough for the old wretch without blows come come sikes said the jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone and motioning towards the boys who were eagerly attentive to all that passed we must have civil words civil words bill it is my living and the cold wet dirty streets are my home and you re the wretch that drove me to them long ago and that ll keep me there day and night day and night till i die i shall do you a mischief interposed the jew goaded by these reproaches a mischief worse than that if you say much more the girl said nothing more but tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion made such a rush at the jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him had not her wrists been seized by sikes at the right moment upon which she made a few ineffectual struggles and fainted she s all right now said sikes laying her down in a corner the jew wiped his forehead and smiled as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over but neither he nor sikes nor the dog nor the boys seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business sikes which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind so s sikes sikes dog there exist strong and singular points of resemblance bring in your body then said sikes well said sikes sikes sikes pouring out a glass of brandy bade the jew drink it off what you re afraid of our getting the better of you are you inquired sikes fixing his eyes on the jew sikes seized the glass and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself which he did at once there said sikes smacking his lips for business replied sikes so say what you ve got to say wot about it inquired sikes sikes let em hear said sikes i don t care sikes did care on reflection he dropped his voice as he said the words and grew calmer not at all replied sikes coldly no not at all rejoined sikes don t tell me but i will tell you retorted sikes do you mean to tell me bill said the jew softening as the other grew heated that neither of the two men in the house can be got over yes i do mean to tell you so replied sikes but do you mean to say my dear remonstrated the jew that the women can t be got over not a bit of it replied sikes think what women are bill no not even by flash toby crackit replied sikes so he did rejoined sikes and they warn t of no more use than the other plant sikes sikes eyed him furtively from time to time fagin said sikes abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed is it worth fifty shiners extra if it s safely done from the outside yes said the jew as suddenly rousing himself is it a bargain inquired sikes then said sikes thrusting aside the jew s hand with some disdain let it come off as soon as you like why whispered sikes as you cross the lawn yes said the jew bending his head forward with his eyes almost starting out of it umph cried sikes stopping short as the girl scarcely moving her head looked suddenly round and pointed for an instant to the jew s face is there no help wanted but yours and toby s none said sikes oh then it s a panel eh never mind wot it is replied sikes sikes reflectively if i d only got that young boy of ned the chimbley sweeper s he kept him small on purpose and let him out by the job sikes his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs so they go on and if they d got money enough which it s a providence they haven t we shouldn t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade in a year or two bill what now inquired sikes sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently as if he thought the precaution unnecessary but complied nevertheless by requesting miss nancy to fetch him a jug of beer i tell you i do replied sikes sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise but wot inquired sikes sikes likewise ha ha ha what about him demanded sikes he exclaimed sikes sikes ruminating frighten him echoed sikes ours said sikes and wot said sikes scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend wot makes you take so much pains about one chalk faced kid when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about common garden every night as you might pick and choose from because they re of no use to me my dear replied the jew with some confusion not worth the taking sikes expressive of the disgust with which he received fagin s affectation of humanity ah to be sure said the jew when is it to be done bill i planned with toby the night arter to morrow rejoined sikes in a surly voice if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy no rejoined sikes sikes nodded and about oh ah it s all planned rejoined sikes interrupting him william sikes and further that the said sikes should deal with him as he thought fit and should not be held responsible by the jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him it being understood that to render the compact in this respect binding any representations made by mr sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated in all important particulars by the testimony of flash toby crackit sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner yelling forth at the same time most unmusical snatches of song mingled with wild execrations sikes while her back was turned groped downstairs william sikes when oliver awoke in the morning he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes with strong thick soles had been placed at his bedside and that his old shoes had been removed at first he was pleased with the discovery hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release but such thoughts were quickly dispelled on his sitting down to breakfast along with the jew who told him in a tone and manner which increased his alarm that he was to be taken to the residence of bill sikes that night he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to sikes which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with fagin and after meditating for a long time concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker until another boy better suited for his purpose could be engaged bill hallo replied sikes appearing at the head of the stairs with a candle sikes temperament bull s eye s gone home with tom observed sikes as he lighted them up so you ve got the kid said sikes when they had all reached the room closing the door as he spoke did he come quiet inquired sikes i m glad to hear it said sikes looking grimly at oliver for the sake of his young carcase as would otherways have suffered for it sikes pulled off oliver s cap and threw it into a corner and then taking him by the shoulder sat himself down by the table and stood the boy in front of him now first do you know wot this is inquired sikes taking up a pocket pistol which lay on the table well then look here continued sikes sikes proceeded to load the pistol with great nicety and deliberation sikes when he had finished sikes continued sikes approvingly women can always put things in fewest words sikes founded upon the singular coincidence of jemmies being a can name common to them and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water and threw himself on the bed ordering nancy with many imprecations in case of failure to call him at five precisely when he awoke the table was covered with tea things and sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great coat which hung over the back of a chair now then growled sikes as oliver started up half past five look sharp or you ll get no breakfast for it s late as it is oliver was not long in making his toilet having taken some breakfast he replied to a surly inquiry from sikes by saying that he was quite ready nancy scarcely looking at the boy threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders sikes struck by way of chiswell street into barbican thence into long lane and so into smithfield from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled oliver twist with amazement sikes dragging oliver after him elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds which so astonished the boy now young un said sikes looking up at the clock of st sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion s wrist oliver quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run kept up with the rapid strides of the house breaker as well as he could they held their course at this rate until they had passed hyde park corner and were on their way to kensington when sikes relaxed his pace until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind came up is that your boy yes he s my boy replied sikes looking hard at oliver and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was not a bit of it replied sikes interposing sikes dismounted with great precipitation holding oliver by the hand all the while and lifting him down directly bestowed a furious look upon him and rapped the side pocket with his fist in a significant manner he s sulky replied sikes giving him a shake he s sulky sikes waited until he had fairly gone and then telling oliver he might look about him if he wanted once again led him onward on his journey they took no notice of oliver and very little of sikes and as sikes took very little notice of them he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves without being much troubled by their company sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes that oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from sikes so you re going on to lower halliford are you inquired sikes ecod he s a good un could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there demanded sikes pushing the ale towards his new friend are you going to halliford going on to shepperton replied sikes why not rejoined sikes you re a going to accommodate us and wot s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so in return the stranger reflected upon this argument with a very profound face having done so he seized sikes by the hand and declared he was a real good fellow sikes replied he was joking as if he had been sober there would have been strong reason to suppose he was oliver and sikes got in without any further ceremony and the man to whom he belonged having lingered for a minute or two to bear him up and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal mounted also not a word was spoken for the driver had grown sleepy and sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation sikes alighted took oliver by the hand and they once again walked on sikes kept straight on until they were close upon the bridge then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left sikes with oliver s hand still in his softly approached the low porch and raised the latch don t make such a row said sikes bolting the door there s bill sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him and you sleeping there as if you took laudanum with your meals and nothing stronger bister sikes exclaimed barney with real or counterfeit joy cub id sir cub id here you get on first said sikes putting oliver in front of him muttering a curse upon his tardiness sikes pushed oliver before him and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire two or three broken chairs a table and a very old couch on which with his legs much higher than his head a man was reposing at full length smoking a long clay pipe only the boy replied sikes drawing a chair towards the fire there there s enough of that interposed sikes impatiently and stooping over his recumbant friend he whispered a few words in his ear at which mr now said sikes as he resumed his seat if you ll give us something to eat and drink while we re waiting you ll put some heart in us or in me at all events oliver looked at sikes in mute and timid wonder and drawing a stool to the fire sat with his aching head upon his hands scarecely knowing where he was or what was passing around him sikes did the same he had better said sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket sikes this done and sikes having satisfied his appetite oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls and drew on their great coats barney opening a cupboard brought forth several articles which he hastily crammed into the pockets the persuaders i ve got em replied sikes now then said sikes holding out his hand oliver who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise and the air and the drink which had been forced upon him put his hand mechanically into that which sikes extended for the purpose take his other hand toby said sikes slap through the town whispered sikes there ll be nobody in the way to night to see us before oliver had time to look round sikes had caught him under the arms and in three or four seconds he and toby were lying on the grass on the other side sikes followed directly get up murmured sikes trembling with rage and drawing the pistol from his pocket get up or i ll strew your brains upon the grass sikes invoking terrific imprecations upon fagin s head for sending oliver on such an errand plied the crowbar vigorously but with little noise now listen you young limb whispered sikes drawing a dark lantern from his pocket and throwing the glare full on oliver s face i m a going to put you through there keep quiet can t you replied sikes with a threatening look crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper and laughed without noise sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent and to get to work this was no sooner done than sikes mounting upon him put oliver gently through the window with his feet first and without leaving hold of his collar planted him safely on the floor inside take this lantern said sikes looking into the room sikes pointing to the street door with the pistol barrel briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way and that if he faltered he would fall dead that instant it s done in a minute said sikes in the same low whisper nothing said sikes releasing his hold of oliver come back suddenly cried sikes aloud sikes had disappeared for an instant but he was up again and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away clasp your arm tighter said sikes as he drew him through the window where are they sikes and the boy where are they where have they been where are they hiding why have they not been here the crack failed said toby faintly sikes is not i suppose inquired the jew with a disappointed countenance sikes and his dog have already figured sikes s residence and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot during the silence the jew looked restlessly about the room as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of sikes having covertly returned listen to me who with six words can strangle sikes as surely as if i had his bull s throat between my fingers now having eased his mind by this discovery and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had that night heard and of ascertaining with his own eyes that sikes had not returned mr chapter xxviii looks after oliver and proceeds with his adventures wolves tear your throats muttered sikes grinding his teeth as sikes growled forth this imprecation with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee and turned his head for an instant to look back at his pursuers for he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol shot and sikes was in no mood to be played with bear a hand with the boy cried sikes beckoning furiously to his confederate quicker cried sikes laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet and drawing a pistol from his pocket sikes again looking round could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them sikes clenched his teeth took one look around threw over the prostrate form of oliver the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ran along the front of the hedge as if to distract the attention of those behind from the spot where the boy lay paused for a second before another hedge which met it at right angles and whirling his pistol high into the air cleared it at a bound and was gone still oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left him he seemed to be still walking between sikes and crackit who were angrily disputing for the very words they said sounded in his ears and when he caught his own attention as it were by making some violent effort to save himself from falling he found that he was talking to them then he was alone with sikes plodding on as on the previous day and as shadowy people passed them he felt the robber s grasp upon his wrist where s confound the fellow what s his rascally name sikes that s it where s sikes you thief the hump backed man stared as if in excess of amazement and indignation then twisting himself dexterously from the doctor s grasp growled forth a volley of horrid oaths and retired into the house william sikes awakening from a nap drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was sikes propounded this question was not one of those he had tenanted previous to the chertsey expedition although it was in the same quarter of the town and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms if they had stood in any need of corroboration sikes s question sikes with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs sikes s temper for as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair he muttered various curses on her awkwardness and struck her whining are you said sikes what fancy have you got in your head now oh you ve thought better of it have you growled sikes marking the tear which trembled in her eye sikes sikes i wouldn t sikes in a savage voice sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which on similar occasions he was accustomed to garnish his threats sikes tried a little blasphemy and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual called for assistance lend a hand to the girl can t you replied sikes impatiently sikes to confront the new comers in some astonishment at their unlooked for appearance sikes i might have been done for twenty times over afore you d have done anything to help me sikes a little soothed as he glanced over the table but what have you got to say for yourself why you should leave me here down in the mouth health blunt and everything else and take no more notice of me all this mortal time than if i was that ere dog hold your din cried sikes as the dog retreated under the bed still growling angrily and what about the other fortnight demanded sikes upon your what growled sikes with excessive disgust no i ll pound it that you han t replied sikes with a bitter grin sikes into a better temper by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter and moreover by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes which after repeated applications to the spirit bottle he condescended to make sikes but i must have some blunt from you to night then you ve got lots at home retorted sikes and i must have some from there i haven t so much as would i don t know how much you ve got and i dare say you hardly know yourself as it would take a pretty long time to count it said sikes but i must have some to night and that s flat sikes sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn t get any more he must accompany him home with the dodger and master bates put the eatables in the cupboard sikes meanwhile flinging himself on the bed and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady s return crackit apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments yawned and inquiring after sikes took up his hat to go suddenly she arose and hurrying on in a direction quite opposite to that in which sikes was awaiting her returned quickened her pace until it gradually resolved into a violent run sikes he did not observe it for merely inquiring if she had brought the money and receiving a reply in the affirmative he uttered a growl of satisfaction and replacing his head upon the pillow resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody and being furthermore in an unusually amiable condition as has been already observed saw nothing unusual in her demeanor and indeed troubled himself so little about her that had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions as that day closed in the girl s excitement increased and when night came on and she sat by watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep there was an unusual paleness in her cheek and a fire in her eye that even sikes observed with astonishment sikes being weak from the fever was lying in bed taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory and had pushed his glass towards nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time when these symptoms first struck him what do you look at me so hard for what foolery is this demanded sikes grasping her by the arm and shaking her roughly but lord what odds in that the tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken seemed to produce a deeper impression on sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them i tell you wot it is said sikes if you haven t caught the fever and got it comin on now there s something more than usual in the wind and something dangerous too there ain t said sikes fixing his eyes upon her and muttering the words to himself there ain t a stauncher hearted gal going or i d have cut her throat three months ago fortifying himself with this assurance sikes drained the glass to the bottom and then with many grumbling oaths called for his physic sikes locking her hand in his fell back upon the pillow turning his eyes upon her face she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl looking fearfully round from time to time as if despite the sleeping draught she expected every moment to feel the pressure of sikes s heavy hand upon her shoulder then stooping softly over the bed she kissed the robber s lips and then opening and closing the room door with noiseless touch hurried from the house those were his words said nancy glancing uneasily round as she had scarcely ceased to do since she began to speak for a vision of sikes haunted her perpetually sikes to sleep hurried on her self imposed mission to rose maylie there advanced towards london by the great north road two persons upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention she remembered that both the crafty jew and the brutal sikes had confided to her schemes which had been hidden from all others in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion her fears for sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery she had refused even for his sake a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her and what more could she do she was resolved sikes and the jew were talking but they paused to listen an hour this side of midnight said sikes raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat you re right for once replied sikes gruffly that s all i know said sikes does you good does it cried sikes i don t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder so take it away said sikes casting off the jew s hand reminds me of being nabbed by the devil returned sikes fagin offered no reply to this compliment but pulling sikes by the sleeve pointed his finger towards nancy who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet and was now leaving the room hallo cried sikes what answer s that retorted sikes then i do said sikes more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed put your head out of the winder replied sikes then you won t have it replied sikes what do you mean bill do you know what you re doing know what i m oh cried sikes turning to fagin she s out of her senses you know or she daren t talk to me in that way no said sikes hear you repeated sikes turning round in his chair to confront her for only one hour do do cut my limbs off one by one cried sikes seizing her roughly by the arm if i don t think the gal s stark raving mad sikes looked on for a minute watching his opportunity and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her struggling and wrestling with him by the way into a small room adjoining where he sat himself on a bench and thrusting her into a chair held her down by force with a caution backed by many oaths to make no more efforts to go out that night sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined fagin wot did she take it into her head to go out to night for do you think asked sikes well i suppose it is growled sikes nor i said sikes i ll let her a little blood without troubling the doctor if she s took that way again said sikes she was hanging about me all day and night too when i was stretched on my back and you like a blackhearted wolf as you are kept yourself aloof said sikes why now she s on the other tack exclaimed sikes turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion whispering sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing fagin took up his hat and bade him good night light him down said sikes who was filling his pipe sikes knew too much and his ruffian taunts had not galled fagin the less because the wounds were hidden but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of sikes and that was one of the chief ends to be attained if without extracting a confession from herself he laid a watch discovered the object of her altered regard and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes of whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs could he not secure her compliance i can said fagin almost aloud mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes the fear of detection and ruin and death and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all these were the passionate considerations which following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain of fagin as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart sitting down and throwing back his outer coat the man displayed the burly frame of sikes wot now cried sikes damme said sikes feeling in his breast with a look of alarm oh you haven t haven t you said sikes looking sternly at him and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the jew s face and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly sikes turned round to where noah was sleeping as if he had not previously observed him suppose he did all this what then what then replied sikes with a tremendous oath i that knows so much and could hang so many besides myself i don t know replied sikes clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion if it was charley or the dodger or bet or i don t care who replied sikes impatiently sikes leant forward in his chair looking on with his hands upon his knees as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in wot d ye mean asked sikes drawing back tell me that again once again just for him to hear said the jew pointing to sikes as he spoke that about nancy said fagin clutching sikes by the wrist as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough tell it again cried fagin tightening his grasp on sikes and brandishing his other hand aloft as the foam flew from his lips they asked her said noah who as he grew more wakeful seemed to have a dawning perception who sikes was they asked her why she didn t come last sunday as she promised hell s fire cried sikes breaking fiercely from the jew let me out said sikes sikes made no reply but pulling open the door of which fagin had turned the lock dashed into the silent streets let it be said sikes thrusting his hand before her chapter xlviii the flight of sikes of all bad deeds that under cover of the darkness had been committed within wide london s bounds since night hung over it that was the worst hah cried sikes starting up whether it is a wine stain fruit stain beer stain water stain paint stain pitch stain mud stain or blood stain the man got no further for sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table and tearing the hat from him burst out of the house sikes remained standing in the street apparently unmoved by what he had just heard and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go do you hear me call come here cried sikes the animal came up from the very force of habit but as sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat he uttered a low growl and started back sikes made a running noose and called him again while he was thus engaged and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs and sikes s dog bounded into the room blanched face sunken eyes hollow cheeks beard of three days growth wasted flesh short thick breath it was the very ghost of sikes damn you all said sikes passing his hand across his forehead you that keep this house said sikes turning his face to crackit do you mean to sell me or to let me lie here till this hunt is over you may stop here if you think it safe returned the person addressed after some hesitation sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it and said is it the body is it buried they shook their heads sikes sat opposite the door so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure toby said the boy falling back as sikes turned his eyes towards him why didn t you tell me this downstairs there had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad charley said sikes stepping forward you monster the man stopped half way and they looked at each other but sikes s eyes sunk gradually to the ground sikes had him down and his knee was on his throat when crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm and pointed to the window open the door of some place where i can lock this screeching hell babe cried sikes fiercely running to and fro and dragging the boy now as easily as if he were an empty sack you know that sikes is dead that monks has confessed that there is no hope of any further gain master charles bates appalled by sikes s crime fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not after all the best the sheep are feeding there when i kneel up early in the morning in my little bed in a closet within my mother s room to look out at it and i see the red light shining on the sun dial and think within myself is the sun dial glad i wonder that it can tell the time again here is our pew in the church i look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch and there i see a stray sheep i don t mean a sinner but mutton half making up his mind to come into the church he was now a huge strong fellow of six feet high broad in proportion and round shouldered but with a simpering boy s face and curly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look peggotty after looking at ham who stood smiling sheepishly over the shellfish without making any attempt to help him said we come you see the wind and tide making in our favour in one of our yarmouth lugs to gravesen wickfield at home uriah heep said my aunt wickfield s at home ma am said uriah heep if you ll please to walk in there pointing with his long hand to the room he meant we got out and leaving him to hold the pony went into a long low parlour looking towards the street from the window of which i caught a glimpse as i went in of uriah heep breathing into the pony s nostrils and immediately covering them with his hand as if he were putting some spell upon him it so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage which ended in the little circular room where i had seen uriah heep s pale face looking out of the window as i came back i saw uriah heep shutting up the office and feeling friendly towards everybody went in and spoke to him and at parting gave him my hand leaning out of the window and seeing one of the faces on the beam ends looking at me sideways i fancied it was uriah heep got up there somehow and shut him out in a hurry we had scarcely done so when uriah heep put in his red head and his lank hand at the door and said here s mr but seeing a light in the little round office and immediately feeling myself attracted towards uriah heep who had a sort of fascination for me i went in there instead i am well aware that i am the umblest person going said uriah heep modestly let the other be where he may he is a partaker of glory at present master copperfield said uriah heep wickfield s business one of these days i said to make myself agreeable and it will be wickfield and heep or heep late wickfield a sweet lady master copperfield said uriah heep oh thank you master copperfield said uriah heep for that remark it is so true umble as i am i know it is so true oh thank you master copperfield he writhed himself quite off his stool in the excitement of his feelings and being off began to make arrangements for going home outside his own domain and unprotected he was a very sheep for the shearers heep who was the dead image of uriah only short heep s humility that she still wore weeds heep s decease she still wore weeds heep making the tea when master copperfield pays us a visit heep it would have been that he might have known his company this afternoon heep an agreeable woman heep has looked forward to this sir a long while heep heep heep gradually got nearer to me and that uriah gradually got opposite to me and that they respectfully plied me with the choicest of the eatables on the table heep began to talk about fathers in law and then i began to tell her about mine but stopped because my aunt had advised me to observe a silence on that subject heep heep mrs heep caught it and threw it back to uriah uriah kept it up a little while then sent it back to mrs heep and so they went on tossing it about until i had no idea who had got it and was quite bewildered micawber known to uriah heep and his mother which i accordingly did heep my son and me to be the friends of master copperfield heep does not require that cultivation which without his knowledge of men and things it would require still it is a rich soil teeming with latent vegetation in short said mr heep good evening heep your servant and then walking out with me in his most fashionable manner making a good deal of noise on the pavement with his shoes and humming a tune as we went micawber and uriah heep walk past arm in arm uriah humbly sensible of the honour that was done him and mr heep s micawber your friend heep is a young fellow who might be attorney general i was heavier at heart when i packed up such of my books and clothes as still remained there to be sent to dover than i cared to show to uriah heep who was so officious to help me that i uncharitably thought him mighty glad that i was going he was always sitting at my little window looking out into the churchyard and i wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies that used to occupy mine on the rosy mornings when i peeped out of that same little window in my night clothes and saw the sheep quietly feeding in the light of the rising sun their cravats were in general stiff i thought and their looks haughty but in this last respect i presently conceived i had done them an injustice for when two or three of them had to rise and answer a question of the presiding dignitary i never saw anything more sheepish uriah heep said i i found uriah heep among the company in a suit of black and in deep humility wickfield s business and perhaps it might be wickfield and heep you may not recollect it but when a person is umble master copperfield a person treasures such things up i recollect talking about it said i though i certainly did not think it very likely then heep oh very imprudent indeed master copperfield returned uriah sighing modestly i fall into captivity i saw no more of uriah heep until the day when agnes left town paul s struck one now i was hopelessly endeavouring to get a licence to marry dora having nothing but one of uriah heep s gloves to offer in exchange which the whole commons rejected and still more or less conscious of my own room i was always tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bed clothes her papa was with her and uriah heep heep and his mother heep you know the chief evil of their presence in the house said agnes is that i cannot be as near papa as i could wish uriah heep being so much between us and cannot watch over him if that is not too bold a thing to say as closely as i would wickfield but uriah heep it was not that he had lost his good looks or his old bearing of a gentleman for that he had not but the thing that struck me most was that with the evidences of his native superiority still upon him he should submit himself to that crawling impersonation of meanness uriah heep if i may umbly make the remark said uriah heep with a writhe i fully agree with miss betsey trotwood and should be only too appy if miss agnes was a partner heep uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried replied that he was pretty well he thanked my aunt and hoped she was the same heep was rather abashed as most people might have been by this explosion which derived great additional force from the indignant manner in which my aunt afterwards moved in her chair and shook her head as if she were making snaps or bounces at him the wonder is that it isn t much worse i only called to say that if there was anything we could do in present circumstances mother or self or wickfield and heep we should be really glad uriah heep said mr apart from that what uriah says i quite concur in oh what a reward it is said uriah drawing up one leg at the risk of bringing down upon himself another visitation from my aunt to be so trusted in but i hope i am able to do something to relieve him from the fatigues of business master copperfield uriah heep is a great relief to me said mr in fact my dear copperfield i have entered into arrangements by virtue of which i stand pledged and contracted to our friend heep to assist and serve him in the capacity of and to be his confidential clerk micawber referred upon a former occasion being thrown down in the form of an advertisement was taken up by my friend heep and led to a mutual recognition of my friend heep said mr my friend heep has not fixed the positive remuneration at too high a figure but he has made a great deal in the way of extrication from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties contingent on the value of my services and on the value of those services i pin my faith micawber boastfully disparaging himself with the old genteel air will be devoted to my friend heep s service for the church said i still pondering between whiles on uriah heep wickfield and heep my aunt beginning i imagine to be made seriously uncomfortable by my prolonged dejection made a pretence of being anxious that i should go to dover to see that all was working well at the cottage which was let and to conclude an agreement with the same tenant for a longer term of occupation wickfield s house i found in the little lower room on the ground floor where uriah heep had been of old accustomed to sit mr a great pursuit he then told me that he had become the tenant of uriah heep s old house and that mrs micawber to quote a favourite expression of my friend heep but it may prove the stepping stone to more ambitious domiciliary accommodation i asked him whether he had reason so far to be satisfied with his friend heep s treatment of him he got up to ascertain if the door were close shut before he replied in a lower voice my dear copperfield a man who labours under the pressure of pecuniary embarrassments is with the generality of people at a disadvantage all i can say is that my friend heep has responded to appeals to which i need not more particularly refer in a manner calculated to redound equally to the honour of his head and of his heart micawber with an air of constraint i speak of my friend heep as i have experience micawber representing it on the desk with the office ruler is the whole range of the human intellect with a trifling exception on the other is that exception that is to say the affairs of messrs wickfield and heep with all belonging and appertaining thereunto heep s whereabouts wickfield and uriah heep heep had asked permission to bring herself and her knitting near the fire in that room on pretence of its having an aspect more favourable for her rheumatics as the wind then was than the drawing room or dining parlour heep in acknowledgement of my inquiries concerning her health but i m only pretty well heep heep heep heep with a prodigious sniff resumed her knitting heep repeatedly complaining that she was worse agnes charitably remained within to bear her company towards the twilight i went out by myself musing on what i ought to do and whether i was justified in withholding from agnes any longer what uriah heep had told me in london for that began to trouble me again very much i stopped and uriah heep came up be umble says father and you ll do and really it ain t done bad it was the first time it had ever occurred to me that this detestable cant of false humility might have originated out of the heep family he knows best meaning uriah heep for he has always been at my elbow whispering me heep whose rheumatic complaint required change of air and who would be charmed to have it in such company uriah heep gave a kind of snivel while the visit at the doctor s was still in progress i observed that the postman brought two or three letters every morning for uriah heep who remained at highgate until the rest went back it being a leisure time and that these were always directed in a business like manner by mr i could not help wondering in my own mind as i contemplated the boiled leg of mutton before me previous to carving it how it came to pass that our joints of meat were of such extraordinary shapes and whether our butcher contracted for all the deformed sheep that came into the world but i kept my reflections to myself thus earnestly besought i made no reference to the doctor for his permission but without any other compromise of the truth than a little softening of the coarseness of uriah heep related plainly what had passed in that same room that night micawber was of me when he became clerk to uriah heep how is our friend heep mr heep once did me the favour to observe to me that if i were not in the receipt of the stipendiary emoluments appertaining to my engagement with him i should probably be a mountebank about the country swallowing a sword blade and eating the devouring element what is the matter gentlemen what is not the matter villainy is the matter baseness is the matter deception fraud conspiracy are the matter and the name of the whole atrocious mass is heep my aunt clapped her hands and we all started up as if we were possessed micawber gasping puffing and sobbing to that degree that he was like a man fighting with cold water until i have blown to fragments the a detestable serpent heep i ll partake of no one s hospitality until i have a moved mount vesuvius to eruption on a the abandoned rascal heep refreshment a underneath this roof particularly punch would a choke me unless i had previously choked the eyes out of the head a of interminable cheat and liar heep i a i ll know nobody and a say nothing and a live nowhere until i have crushed to a undiscoverable atoms the transcendent and immortal hypocrite and perjurer heep i really had some fear of mr the manner in which he struggled through these inarticulate sentences and whenever he found himself getting near the name of heep fought his way on to it dashed at it in a fainting state and brought it out with a vehemence little less than marvellous was frightful but now when he sank into a chair steaming and looked at us with every possible colour in his face that had no business there and an endless procession of lumps following one another in hot haste up his throat whence they seemed to shoot into his forehead he had the appearance of being in the last extremity no copperfield no communication a until miss wickfield a redress from wrongs inflicted by consummate scoundrel heep i am quite convinced he could not have uttered three words but for the amazing energy with which this word inspired him when he felt it coming micawber and myself auld lang syne in chorus and a will expose intolerable ruffian heep no more to say a or listen to persuasion go immediately not capable a bear society upon the track of devoted and doomed traitor heep with this last repetition of the magic word that had kept him going at all and in which he surpassed all his previous efforts mr i would beg to be allowed a start of five minutes by the clock and then to receive the present company inquiring for miss wickfield at the office of wickfield and heep whose stipendiary i am dixon i had not seen uriah heep since the time of the blow heep said traddles whose eye the cunning red eye accidentally caught as it at once scrutinized and evaded us heep micawber suddenly breaking out again with the utmost vehemence with whom i have already talked too much that scoundrel s name is heep uriah fell back as if he had been struck or stung heep is here sir said traddles returning with that worthy mother of a worthy son heep heep began with an anxious gesture micawber without looking off the letter pointed the ruler like a ghostly truncheon at uriah heep i ask no consideration for myself in an accumulation of ignominy want despair and madness i entered the office or as our lively neighbour the gaul would term it the bureau of the firm nominally conducted under the appellation of wickfield and heep but in reality wielded by heep alone heep and only heep is the mainspring of that machine heep and only heep is the forger and the cheat approach me again you you you heep of infamy gasped mr the stipendiary emoluments in consideration of which i entered into the service of heep always pausing before that word and uttering it with astonishing vigour were not defined beyond the pittance of twenty two shillings and six per week the rest was left contingent on the value of my professional exertions in other and more expressive words on the baseness of my nature the cupidity of my motives the poverty of my family the general moral or rather immoral resemblance between myself and heep need i say that it soon became necessary for me to solicit from heep pecuniary advances towards the support of mrs micawber and our blighted but rising family need i say that this necessity had been foreseen by heep that those advances were secured by i he read on then it was that heep began to favour me with just so much of his confidence as was necessary to the discharge of his infernal business was imposed upon kept in ignorance and deluded in every possible way yet that all this while the ruffian heep was professing unbounded gratitude to and unbounded friendship for that much abused gentleman my object when the contest within myself between stipend and no stipend baker and no baker existence and non existence ceased was to take advantage of my opportunities to discover and expose the major malpractices committed to that gentleman s grievous wrong and injury by heep my charges against heep he read on glancing at him and drawing the ruler into a convenient position under his left arm in case of need are as follows s faculties and memory for business became through causes into which it is not necessary or expedient for me to enter weakened and confused heep designedly perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions was least fit to enter on business heep was always at hand to force him to enter on it all in good time ask heep mr ask heep if he ever kept a pocket book in that house said mr heep has on several occasions to the best of my knowledge information and belief but that won t do muttered uriah relieved heep has on several occasions to the best of my knowledge information and belief systematically forged to various entries books and documents the signature of mr being infirm and it being within the bounds of probability that his decease might lead to some discoveries and to the downfall of heep s power over the w family as i wilkins micawber the undersigned assume unless the filial affection of his daughter could be secretly influenced from allowing any investigation of the partnership affairs to be ever made the said heep deemed it expedient to have a bond ready by him as from mr for the before mentioned sum of twelve six fourteen two and nine with interest stated therein to have been advanced by heep to mr and attested by wilkins micawber are forgeries by heep uriah heep with a start took out of his pocket a bunch of keys and opened a certain drawer then suddenly bethought himself of what he was about and turned again towards us without looking in it heep i am now in a condition to show by heep s false books and heep s real memoranda beginning with the partially destroyed pocket book which i was unable to comprehend at the time of its accidental discovery by mrs have been for years acted on by and warped to the base purposes of heep has been for years deluded and plundered in every conceivable manner to the pecuniary aggrandisement of the avaricious false and grasping heep that the engrossing object of heep was next to gain to subdue mr to execute a relinquishment of his share in the partnership and even a bill of sale on the very furniture of his house in consideration of a certain annuity to be well and truly paid by heep on the four common quarter days in each and every year had launched into imprudent and ill judged speculations and may not have had the money for which he was morally and legally responsible in hand going on with pretended borrowings of money at enormous interest really coming from heep and by heep fraudulently obtained or withheld from mr what was my astonishment when i beheld my aunt who had been profoundly quiet and attentive make a dart at uriah heep and seize him by the collar with both hands you know what i want said my aunt heep had been clamouring to her son to be umble and had been going down on her knees to all of us in succession and making the wildest promises heep broke out again crying on her knees to agnes to interfere in their behalf exclaiming that he was very humble and it was all true and if he didn t do what we wanted she would and much more to the same purpose being half frantic with fears for her darling dick accompanied her as a shepherd s dog might accompany a sheep heep gave him little trouble for she not only returned with the deed but with the box in which it was where we found a banker s book and some other papers that were afterwards serviceable heep you can retire to think particularly observing if you please that i declare to you on the part of all present that there is only one thing to be done that it is what i have explained and that it must be done without delay micawber called the final pulverization of heep and for the departure of the emigrants dick too said traddles has been doing wonders as soon as he was released from overlooking uriah heep whom he kept in such charge as i never saw exceeded he began to devote himself to mr micawber did right for right s sake when we reflect what terms he might have made with uriah heep himself for his silence micawber s memorable denunciation a threatening allusion was made by uriah heep to your aunt s husband micawber s liabilities in not being comprehended in the terms he had made that we were no longer of any authority with uriah heep and that if he could do us or any of us any injury or annoyance no doubt he would we being quite prepared for this event which was of course a proceeding of uriah heep s soon paid the money and in five minutes more mr we passed the night at the old house which freed from the presence of the heeps seemed purged of a disease and i lay in my old room like a shipwrecked wanderer come home my dear madam and copperfield the fair land of promise lately looming on the horizon is again enveloped in impenetrable mists and for ever withdrawn from the eyes of a drifting wretch whose doom is sealed another writ has been issued in his majesty s high court of king s bench at westminster in another cause of heep v at length the same boy reappeared and presented me with a note written in pencil and headed in a legal manner heep v micawber had just now been arrested again and for the last time at the suit of heep and that in compliance with a request i had made to him he had paid the money which i repaid him i returned and looking as i passed through the low window of the turret room where first uriah heep and afterwards mr all the little changes that had crept in when the heeps were there were changed again this was done and whom should traddles and i then behold to our amazement in this converted number twenty seven but uriah heep he knew us directly and said as he came out with the old writhe how do you do mr how do you find yourself today i am very umble sir replied uriah heep here another gentleman asked with extreme anxiety are you quite comfortable yes i thank you sir said uriah heep looking in that direction what with sheep farming and what with stock farming and what with one thing and what with t other we are as well to do as well could be quilp is my name it s not a long one daniel quilp harkee mr quilp then pursued the other you have some influence with my grandfather there some said mr quilp emphatically a few replied quilp with equal dryness sir sir i am your humble servant said mr quilp to whom the monosyllable was addressed proceed sir said daniel quilp for the orator had made a sudden stop is what demanded quilp ask mrs quilp pretty mrs quilp obedient timid loving mrs quilp oh well trained mrs quilp the dwarf watched him sharply while he passed into the little sitting room and locked it in an iron safe above the chimney piece and after musing for a short space prepared to take his leave observing that unless he made good haste mrs quilp would certainly be in fits on his return chapter 4 mr and mrs quilp resided on tower hill and in her bower on tower hill mrs quilp was left to pine the absence of her lord when he quitted her on the business which he had already seen to transact mr quilp could scarcely be said to be of any particular trade or calling though his pursuits were diversified and his occupations numerous on the surrey side of the river was a small rat infested dreary yard called quilp s wharf in which were a little wooden counting house burrowing all awry in the dust as if it had fallen from the clouds and ploughed into the ground a few fragments of rusty anchors several large iron rings some piles of rotten wood and two or three heaps of old sheet copper crumpled cracked and battered on quilp s wharf daniel quilp was a ship breaker yet to judge from these appearances he must either have been a ship breaker on a very small scale or have broken his ships up very small indeed the dwarf s lodging on tower hill comprised besides the needful accommodation for himself and mrs quilp a small sleeping closet for that lady s mother who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war with daniel of whom notwithstanding she stood in no slight dread over nobody had he such complete ascendance as mrs quilp herself a pretty little mild spoken blue eyed woman who having allied herself in wedlock to the dwarf in one of those strange infatuations of which examples are by no means scarce performed a sound practical penance for her folly every day of her life it has been said that mrs quilp was pining in her bower it was natural for four reasons firstly because mrs quilp being a young woman and notoriously under the dominion of her husband ought to be excited to rebel secondly because mrs quilp s parent was known to be laudably shrewish in her disposition and inclined to resist male authority thirdly because each visitor wished to show for herself how superior she was in this respect to the generality of her sex and fourthly because the company being accustomed to scandalise each other in pairs were deprived of their usual subject of conversation now that they were all assembled in close friendship and had consequently no better employment than to attack the common enemy moved by these considerations a stout lady opened the proceedings by inquiring with an air of great concern and sympathy how mr quilp was whereunto mr quilp s wife s mother replied sharply oh he was well enough nothing much was every the matter with him and ill weeds were sure to thrive all the ladies then sighed in concert shook their heads gravely and looked at mrs quilp as a martyr ah said the spokeswoman i wish you d give her a little of your advice mrs jiniwin mrs quilp had been a miss jiniwin it should be observed nobody knows better than you ma am what us women owe to ourselves how often have i said the same words to you and almost gone down my knees when i spoke em poor mrs quilp who had looked in a state of helplessness from one face of condolence to another coloured smiled and shook her head doubtfully it s all very fine to talk said mrs quilp with much simplicity but i know that if i was to die to morrow quilp could marry anybody he pleased now that he could i know there was quite a scream of indignation at this idea very well said mrs quilp nodding her head as i said just now it s very easy to talk but i say again that i know that i m sure quilp has such a way with him when he likes that the best looking woman here couldn t refuse him if i was dead and she was free and he chose to make love to her and yet for some hidden reason they were all angry with the widow and each lady whispered in her neighbour s ear that it was very plain that said widow thought herself the person referred to and what a puss she was mother knows said mrs quilp that what i say is quite correct for she often said so before we were married didn t you say so mother this inquiry involved the respected lady in rather a delicate position for she certainly had been an active party in making her daughter mrs quilp and besides it was not supporting the family credit to encourage the idea that she had married a man whom nobody else would have before i d let a man order me about as quilp orders her said mrs george before i d consent to stand in awe of a man as she does of him i d i d kill myself and write a letter first to say he did it this remark being loudly commended and approved of another lady from the minories put in her word mr quilp may be a very nice man said this lady and i supposed there s no doubt he is because mrs quilp says he is and mrs jiniwin says he is and they ought to know or nobody does a third who in the general confusion could secure no other listener fastened herself upon a young woman still unmarried who happened to be amongst them and conjured her as she valued her own peace of mind and happiness to profit by this solemn occasion to take example from the weakness of mrs quilp and from that time forth to direct her whole thoughts to taming and subduing the rebellious spirit of man then and not until then daniel quilp himself the cause and occasion of all this clamour was observed to be in the room looking on and listening with profound attention mrs quilp pray ask the ladies to stop to supper and have a couple of lobsters and something light and palatable i i didn t ask them to tea quilp stammered his wife so much the better mrs quilp these accidental parties are always the pleasantest said the dwarf rubbing his hands so hard that he seemed to be engaged in manufacturing of the dirt with which they were encrusted little charges for popguns and why not stop to supper quilp said the old lady if my daughter had a mind to be sure rejoined daniel not even to have a score of mothers in law at the same time and what a blessing that would be my daughter s your wife mr quilp certainly said the old lady with a giggle meant for satirical and to imply that he needed to be reminded of the fact your wedded wife and she has a right to do as she likes i hope quilp said the old lady trembling partly with anger and partly with a secret fear of her impish son in law oh don t you know she has don t you know she has mrs jiniwin i know she ought to have quilp and would have if she was of my way of thinking her father was a blessed creetur quilp and worthy twenty thousand of some people said mrs jiniwin twenty hundred million thousand i believe he had suffered a long time the old lady gave a gasp but nothing came of it quilp resumed with the same malice in his eye and the same sarcastic politeness on his tongue i shall go when i please quilp and not before mrs quilp he said at last yes quilp she replead meekly instead of pursuing the theme he had in his mind quilp folded his arms again and looked at her more sternly than before while she averted her eyes and kept them on the ground mrs quilp yes quilp with this laconic threat which he accompanied with a snarl that gave him the appearance of being particularly in earnest mr quilp bade her clear the teaboard away and bring the rum now mrs quilp he said i feel in a smoking humour and shall probably blaze away all night his wife returned no other reply than the necessary yes quilp and the small lord of the creation took his first cigar and mixed his first glass of grog the sun went down and the stars peeped out the tower turned from its own proper colours to grey and from grey to black the room became perfectly dark and the end of the cigar a deep fiery red but still mr quilp went on smoking and drinking in the same position and staring listlessly out of window with the doglike smile always on his face save when mrs quilp made some involuntary movement of restlessness or fatigue and then it expanded into a grin of delight chapter 5 whether mr quilp took any sleep by snatches of a few winks at a time or whether he sat with his eyes wide open all night long certain it is that he kept his cigar alight and kindled every fresh one from the ashes of that which was nearly consumed without requiring the assistance of a candle at length the day broke and poor mrs quilp shivering with cold of early morning and harassed by fatigue and want of sleep was discovered sitting patiently on her chair raising her eyes at intervals in mute appeal to the compassion and clemency of her lord and gently reminding him by an occasion cough that she was still unpardoned and that her penance had been of long duration open the door sweet mrs quilp his obedient wife withdrew the bolt and her lady mother entered why betsy said the old woman you haven t been you don t mean to say you ve been a sitting up all night said quilp supplying the conclusion of the sentence is the dear old lady deaf said quilp with a smile of which a frown was part come come said quilp wilfully misunderstanding her of course you mustn t call her names mrs quilp yes quilp said the timid sufferer help your mother to get breakfast mrs quilp while they were in progress mr quilp withdrew to the adjoining room and turning back his coat collar proceeded to smear his countenance with a damp towel of very unwholesome appearance which made his complexion rather more cloudy than it was before mr quilp now walked up to front of a looking glass and was standing there putting on his neckerchief when mrs jiniwin happening to be behind him could not resist the inclination she felt to shake her fist at her tyrant son in law at last having gone through these proceedings and many others which were equally a part of his system mr quilp left them reduced to a very obedient and humbled state and betook himself to the river side where he took boat for the wharf on which he had bestowed his name it was flood tide when daniel quilp sat himself down in the ferry to cross to the opposite shore daniel quilp who was not much affected by a bright morning save in so far as it spared him the trouble of carrying an umbrella caused himself to be put ashore hard by the wharf and proceeded thither through a narrow lane which partaking of the amphibious character of its frequenters had as much water as mud in its composition and a very liberal supply of both he was speedily brought on his heels by the sound of his master s voice and as soon as his head was in its right position mr quilp to speak expressively in the absence of a better verb punched it for him come you let me alone said the boy parrying quilp s hand with both his elbows alternatively you dog snarled quilp i ll beat you with an iron rod i ll scratch you with a rusty nail i ll pinch your eyes if you talk to me i will you won t do it agin said the boy nodding his head and drawing back with the elbows ready in case of the worst now stand still you dog said quilp where is there one of my size you dog returned quilp the boy sulkily complied muttering at first but desisting when he looked round and saw that quilp was following him with a steady look quilp would certainly suffer nobody to contract him but the boy and the boy would assuredly not have submitted to be so knocked about by anybody but quilp when he had the power to run away at any time he chose now said quilp passing into the wooden counting house you mind the wharf the boy made no answer but directly quilp had shut himself in stood on his head before the door then walked on his hands to the back and stood on his head there and then to the opposite side and repeated the performance there were indeed four sides to the counting house but he avoided that one where the window was deeming it probable that quilp would be looking out of it daniel quilp pulled his hat over his brows climbed on to the desk which had a flat top and stretching his short length upon it went to sleep with ease of an old practitioner intending no doubt to compensate himself for the deprivation of last night s rest by a long and sound nap quilp was a light sleeper and started up directly ask said quilp seizing the trifle of wood before mentioned and throwing it at him with such dexterity that it was well the boy disappeared before it reached the spot on which he had stood what nelly cried quilp come in said quilp without getting off the desk you re sure he is said quilp mr quilp without changing his position further than to turn over a little more on his side and rest his chin on his hand proceeded to make himself acquainted with its contents chapter 6 little nell stood timidly by with her eyes raised to the countenance of mr quilp as he read the letter plainly showing by her looks that while she entertained some fear and distrust of the little man she was much inclined to laugh at his uncouth appearance and grotesque attitude that mr quilp was himself perplexed and that in no small degree by the contents of the letter was sufficiently obvious well muttered quilp as he marked her earnest look there s no hurry little nell no hurry at all said quilp how should you like to be my number two nelly to be what sir my number two nelly my second my mrs quilp said the dwarf the child looked frightened but seemed not to understand him which mr quilp observing hastened to make his meaning more distinctly to be mrs quilp the second when mrs quilp the first is dead sweet nell said quilp wrinkling up his eyes and luring her towards him with his bent forefinger to be my wife my little cherry cheeked red lipped wife say that mrs quilp lives five year or only four you ll be just the proper age for me ha ha be a good girl nelly a very good girl and see if one of these days you don t come to be mrs quilp of tower hill mr quilp either because frightening anybody afforded him a constitutional delight or because it was pleasant to contemplate the death of mrs quilp number one and the elevation of mrs quilp number two to her post and title or because he was determined from purposes of his own to be agreeable and good humoured at that particular time only laughed and feigned to take no heed of her alarm you shall come with me to tower hill and see mrs quilp that is directly said the dwarf with that mr quilp suffered himself to roll gradually off the desk until his short legs touched the ground when he got upon them and led the way from the counting house to the wharf outside when the first objects that presented themselves were the boy who had stood on his head and another young gentleman of about his own stature rolling in the mud together locked in a tight embrace and cuffing each other with mutual heartiness it s kit cried nelly clasping her hand poor kit who came with me oh pray stop them mr quilp i ll stop em cried quilp diving into the little counting house and returning with a thick stick i ll stop em i ll beat you to a pulp you dogs said quilp vainly endeavoring to get near either of them for a parting blow come a little nearer and i ll drop it on your skull you dog said quilp with gleaming eyes a little nearer nearer yet quilp who was as strong as a lion easily kept his hold until the boy was tugging at it with his utmost power when he suddenly let it go and sent him reeling backwards so that he fell violently upon his head the success of this manoeuvre tickled mr quilp beyond description and he laughed and stamped upon the ground as at a most irresistible jest do you mean to say i m not you dog returned quilp then what do you fight on my wharf for you villain said quilp said quilp with great suavity in his manner but still more of quiet malice about his eyes and mouth then mr quilp departed with the child and kit in a boat and the boy revenged himself by dancing on his head at intervals on the extreme verge of the wharf during the whole time they crossed the river there was only mrs quilp at home and she little expecting the return of her lord was just composing herself for a refreshing slumber when the sound of his footsteps roused her here s nelly trent dear mrs quilp said her husband mrs quilp looked tremblingly in her spouse s face to know what this unusual courtesy might portend and obedient to the summons she saw in his gesture followed him into the next room mind what i say to you whispered quilp do you hear yes quilp what s the matter now dear quilp faltered his wife do you hear me whispered quilp nipping and pinching her arm worm yourself into her secrets i know you can go mrs quilp departed according to order and her amiable husband ensconcing himself behind the partly opened door and applying his ear close to it began to listen with a face of great craftiness and attention poor mrs quilp was thinking however in what manner to begin or what kind of inquiries she could make and it was not until the door creaking in a very urgent manner warned her to proceed without further consideration that the sound of her voice was heard how very often you have come backwards and forwards lately to mr quilp my dear returned mrs quilp with an uneasy glance towards it i am very very sorry to hear you speak like this my dear said mrs quilp he ll alter again nelly said mrs quilp and be what he was before oh if god would only let that come about said the child with streaming eyes but it is a long time now since he first began to i thought i saw that door moving it s the wind said mrs quilp faintly mrs quilp turned away her head and made no answer but now we never have these walks and though it is the same house it is darker and much more gloomy than it used to be indeed she paused here but though the door creaked more than once mrs quilp said nothing you do not know how fond he is of me i am sure he loves you dearly said mrs quilp in a few minutes mr quilp returned and expressed the utmost surprise to find her in this condition which he did very naturally and with admirable effect for that kind of acting had been rendered familiar to him by long practice and he was quite at home in it she s tired you see mrs quilp said the dwarf squinting in a hideous manner to imply that his wife was to follow his lead poor nell mr quilp unintentionally adopted the very best means he could have devised for the recovery of his young visitor by patting her on the head but you d better wait and dine with mrs quilp and me well said mr quilp if you will go you will nelly here you sir take care of her d ye hear kit who appeared at the summons deigned to make no reply to so needless an injunction and after staring at quilp in a threatening manner as if he doubted whether he might not have been the cause of nelly shedding tears and felt more than half disposed to revenge the fact upon him on the mere suspicion turned about and followed his young mistress who had by this time taken her leave of mrs quilp and departed you re a keen questioner an t you mrs quilp said the dwarf turning upon her as soon as they were left alone what more could you do sneered quilp couldn t you have done something less couldn t you have done what you had to do without appearing in your favourite part of the crocodile you minx i am very sorry for the child quilp said his wife you led her on you did a great deal truly said quilp mrs quilp being fully persuaded of this made no reply her husband added with some exultation but you may thank your fortunate stars the same stars that made you mrs quilp you may thank them that i m upon the old gentleman s track and have got a new light so saying mr quilp put his hat on and took himself off and mrs quilp who was afflicted beyond measure by the recollection of the part she had just acted shut herself up in her chamber and smothering her head in the bed clothes bemoaned her fault more bitterly than many less tender hearted persons would have mourned a much greater offence for in the majority of cases conscience is an elastic and very flexible article which will bear a deal of stretching and adapt itself to a great variety of circumstances chapter 9 the child in her confidence with mrs quilp had but feebly described the sadness and sorrow of her thoughts or the heaviness of the cloud which overhung her home and cast dark shadows on its hearth one night the third after nelly s interview with mrs quilp the old man who had been weak and ill all day said he should not leave home and yet other ears and eyes were there and greedily taking in all that passed and moreover they were the ears and eyes of no less a person than mr daniel quilp who having entered unseen when the child first placed herself at the old man s side refrained actuated no doubt by motives of the purest delicacy from interrupting the conversation and stood looking on with his accustomed grin not at all disconcerted by this reception daniel quilp preserved the same attitude merely nodding twice or thrice with great condescension through the door said quilp pointing over his shoulder with his thumb quilp looked after her with an admiring leer and when she had closed the door fell to complimenting the old man upon her charms such a fresh blooming modest little bud neighbour said quilp nursing his short leg and making his eyes twinkle very much such a chubby rosy cosy little nell the old man answered by a forced smile and was plainly struggling with a feeling of the keenest and most exquisite impatience it was not lost upon quilp who delighted in torturing him or indeed anybody else when he could she s so said quilp speaking very slowly and feigning to be quite absorbed in the subject so small so compact so beautifully modelled so fair with such blue veins and such a transparent skin and such little feet and such winning ways but bless me you re nervous why neighbour what s the matter i swear to you continued the dwarf dismounting from the chair and sitting down in it with a careful slowness of gesture very different from the rapidity with which he had sprung up unheard i swear to you that i had no idea old blood ran so fast or kept so warm here he remained with his head bowed upon his breast for some time and then suddenly raising it said once and once for all have you brought me any money no returned quilp then said the old man clenching his hands desperately and looking upwards the child and i are lost neighbour said quilp glancing sternly at him and beating his hand twice or thrice upon the table to attract his wandering attention let me be plain with you and play a fairer game than when you held all the cards and i saw but the backs and nothing more you are surprised said quilp to the gaming table rejoined quilp your nightly haunt that i should have been blinded said quilp looking contemptuously at him by a mere shallow gambler i am no gambler cried the old man fiercely who would not have hoped in such a cause tell me that who would not have hoped as i did when did you first begin this mad career asked quilp his taunting inclination subdued for a moment by the old man s grief and wildness after you first came to me to get your precious grandson packed off to sea said quilp while i thought you were making your fortune as you said you were you were making yourself a beggar eh dear me and so it comes to pass that i hold every security you could scrape together and a bill of sale upon the upon the stock and property said quilp standing up and looking about him as if to assure himself that none of it had been taken away quilp i have dreamed three nights of winning the same large sum i never could dream that dream before though i have often tried see quilp good tender hearted quilp said the old man drawing some scraps of paper from his pocket with a trembling hand and clasping the dwarf s arm only see here i only want a little help once more a few pounds but two score pounds dear quilp quilp consider consider the old man cried trembling so much the while that the papers in his hand fluttered as if they were shaken by the wind that orphan child if i were alone i could die with gladness perhaps even anticipate that doom which is dealt out so unequally coming as it does on the proud and happy in their strength and shunning the needy and afflicted and all who court it in their despair but what i have done has been for her help me for her sake i implore you not for mine for hers i m sorry i ve got an appointment in the city said quilp looking at his watch with perfect self possession or i should have been very glad to have spent half an hour with you while you composed yourself very glad nay quilp good quilp gasped the old man catching at his skirts you and i have talked together more than once of her poor mother s story oh spare me the money for this one last hope i couldn t do it really said quilp with unusual politeness though i tell you what and this is a circumstance worth bearing in mind as showing how the sharpest among us may be taken in sometimes i was so deceived by the penurious way in which you lived alone with nelly all done to save money for tempting fortune and to make her triumph greater cried the old man yes yes i understand that now said quilp but i was going to say i was so deceived by that your miserly way the reputation you had among those who knew you of being rich and your repeated assurances that you would make of my advances treble and quadruple the interest you paid me that i d have advanced you even now what you want on your simple note of hand if i hadn t unexpectedly become acquainted with your secret way of life poor kit muttered quilp chapter 10 daniel quilp neither entered nor left the old man s house unobserved even the sick chamber seemed to be retained on the uncertain tenure of mr quilp s favour to this end mr quilp encamped in the back parlour having first put an effectual stop to any further business by shutting up the shop the apartment was very far removed from the old man s chamber but mr quilp deemed it prudent as a precaution against infection from fever and a means of wholesome fumigation not only to smoke himself without cessation but to insist upon it that his legal friend did the like these arrangements completed mr quilp looked round him with chuckling satisfaction and remarked that he called that comfort but as he was quite a creature of mr quilp s and had a thousand reasons for conciliating his good opinion he tried to smile and nodded his acquiescence with the best grace he could assume quilp looked at his legal adviser and seeing that he was winking very much in the anguish of his pipe that he sometimes shuddered when he happened to inhale its full flavour and that he constantly fanned the smoke from him was quite overjoyed and rubbed his hands with glee smoke away you dog said quilp turning to the boy fill your pipe again and smoke it fast down to the last whiff or i ll put the sealing waxed end of it in the fire and rub it red hot upon your tongue is it good brass is it nice is it fragrant do you feel like the grand turk said quilp this is the way to keep off fever said quilp this is the way to keep off every calamity of life we ll never leave off all the time we stop here smoke away you dog or you shall swallow the pipe shall we stop here long mr quilp inquired his legal friend when the dwarf had given his boy this gentle admonition we must stop i suppose till the old gentleman up stairs is dead returned quilp he he he laughed mr brass oh very good smoke away cried quilp but if he should get better mr quilp then we shall stop till he does and no longer returned the dwarf the what you dog said quilp are you deaf oh said quilp drawing in his breath with great relish as if he were taking soup you and i will have such a settling presently there s such a scratching and bruising in store for you my dear young friend aha nelly how is he now my duck of diamonds he s very bad replied the weeping child what a pretty little nell cried quilp has she come to sit upon quilp s knee said the dwarf in what he meant to be a soothing tone or is she going to bed in her own little room inside here which is poor nelly going to do what a remarkable pleasant way he has with children muttered brass as if in confidence between himself and the ceiling upon my word it s quite a treat to hear him she s very sensitive said quilp looking after her mr brass applauding this picture very much and the bed being soft and comfortable mr quilp determined to use it both as a sleeping place by night and as a kind of divan by day and in order that it might be converted to the latter purpose at once remained where he was and smoked his pipe out such were mr quilp s first proceedings on entering upon his new property nell shrank timidly from all the dwarf s advances towards conversation and fled from the very sound of his voice nor were the lawyer s smiles less terrible to her than quilp s grimaces before mr brass had repeated his inquiry many times mr quilp also embellished with a night cap emerged from the same door and looked carefully up and down the street and up at all the windows of the house from the opposite side yes he said without emotion it was quilp he knew quilp was master there you see pursued quilp after a short pause the goods being once removed this house would be uncomfortable uninhabitable in fact mr quilp seemed rather puzzled by the strange even spiritless way in which all this was said but as the old man nodded his head and repeated on friday morning at last they reached the passage on the ground floor where the snoring of mr quilp and his legal friend sounded more terrible in their ears than the roars of lions then the child remembered for the first time one of the nurses having told her that quilp always locked both the house doors at night and kept the keys on the table in his bedroom here she stood for a few moments quite transfixed with terror at the sight of mr quilp who was hanging so far out of bed that he almost seemed to be standing on his head and who either from the uneasiness of this posture or in one of his agreeable habits was gasping and growling with his mouth wide open and the whites or rather the dirty yellows of his eyes distinctly visible chapter 13 daniel quilp of tower hill and sampson brass of bevis marks in the city of london gentleman one of her majesty s attornies of the courts of the king s bench and common pleas at westminster and a solicitor of the high court of chancery slumbered on unconscious and unsuspicious of any mischance until a knocking on the street door often repeated and gradually mounting up from a modest single rap to a perfect battery of knocks fired in long discharges with a very short interval between caused the said daniel quilp to struggle into a horizontal position and to stare at the ceiling with a drowsy indifference betokening that he heard the noise and rather wondered at the same and couldn t be at the trouble of bestowing any further thought upon the subject as the knocking however instead of accommodating itself to his lazy state increased in vigour and became more importunate as if in earnest remonstrance against his falling asleep again now that he had once opened his eyes daniel quilp began by degrees to comprehend the possibility of there being somebody at the door and thus he gradually came to recollect that it was friday morning and he had ordered mrs quilp to be in waiting upon him at an early hour seeing that mr quilp invested himself in his every day garments he hastened to do the like putting on his shoes before his stockings and thrusting his legs into his coat sleeves and making such other small mistakes in his toilet as are not uncommon to those who dress in a hurry and labour under the agitation of having been suddenly roused how should you repeated quilp with a sneer notwithstanding that mr quilp had a strong conviction to the contrary founded on his recollection of having carefully taken it out he was fain to admit that this was possible and therefore went grumbling to the door where sure enough he found it now just as mr quilp laid his hand upon the lock and saw with great astonishment that the fastenings were undone the knocking came again with the most irritating violence and the daylight which had been shining through the key hole was intercepted on the outside by a human eye the dwarf was very much exasperated and wanting somebody to wreak his ill humour upon determined to dart out suddenly and favour mrs quilp with a gentle acknowledgment of her attention in making that hideous uproar so far however from rushing upon somebody who offered no resistance and implored his mercy mr quilp was no sooner in the arms of the individual whom he had taken for his wife than he found himself complimented with two staggering blows on the head and two more of the same quality in the chest and closing with his assailant such a shower of buffets rained down upon his person as sufficed to convince him that he was in skilful and experienced hands then and not until then daniel quilp found himself all flushed and dishevelled in the middle of the street with mr richard swiveller performing a kind of dance round him and requiring to know whether he wanted any more there s plenty more of it at the same shop said mr swiveller by turns advancing and retreating in a threatening attitude a large and extensive assortment always on hand country orders executed with promptitude and despatch will you have a little more sir don t say no if you d rather not i thought it was somebody else said quilp rubbing his shoulders why didn t you say who you were why didn t you say who you were returned dick instead of flying out of the house like a bedlamite it was you that that knocked said the dwarf getting up with a short groan was it yes i am the man replied dick as he said this he pointed towards mrs quilp who stood trembling at a little distance you came for some purpose i suppose said quilp now mrs quilp after you ma am mrs quilp hesitated but mr quilp insisted mr swiveller who was not in the secret was a little surprised to hear a suppressed scream and looking round to see mrs quilp following him with a sudden jerk but he did not remark on these appearances and soon forgot them now mrs quilp said the dwarf when they had entered the shop go you up stairs if you please to nelly s room and tell her that she s wanted you seem to make yourself at home here said dick who was unacquainted with mr quilp s authority dick was pondering what these words might mean and still more what the presence of mr brass might mean when mrs quilp came hurrying down stairs declaring that the rooms above were empty i give you my word quilp answered his trembling wife that i have been into every room and there s not a soul in any of them and that said mr brass clapping his hands once with an emphasis explains the mystery of the key quilp looked frowningly at him and frowningly at his wife and frowningly at richard swiveller but receiving no enlightenment from any of them hurried up stairs whence he soon hurried down again confirming the report which had already been made still glancing furtively at him quilp turned to mr brass and observed with assumed carelessness that this need not interfere with the removal of the goods quilp shook his head and pursed up his lips in a manner which implied that he knew very well but was not at liberty to say and what said dick looking at the confusion about him what do you mean by moving the goods that i have bought em sir rejoined quilp in his secret heart daniel quilp was both surprised and troubled by the flight which had been made it must not be supposed or it would be a gross injustice to mr quilp that he was tortured by any disinterested anxiety on behalf of either mr quilp nodded and said he certainly would the very first time he saw them will you have the goodness to charge yourself with that commission sir certainly rejoined quilp i beg your pardon will you allow me to look at that card again oh by all means rejoined quilp quilp bade him good day the perpetual grand master of the glorious apollers elevating his hat in honour of mrs quilp dropped it carelessly on the side of his head again and disappeared with a flourish not to be behind hand in the bustle mr quilp went to work with surprising vigour hustling and driving the people about like an evil spirit setting mrs quilp upon all kinds of arduous and impracticable tasks carrying great weights up and down with no apparent effort kicking the boy from the wharf whenever he could get near him and inflicting with his loads a great many sly bumps and blows on the shoulders of mr brass as he stood upon the door steps to answer all the inquiries of curious neighbours which was his department assured that it was kit though he saw little more than his nose mr quilp hailed him by his name whereupon kit came in and demanded what he wanted do you mean to say you don t know where answered quilp sharply come retorted quilp let s have no more of this do you mean to say that you don t know they went away by stealth as soon as it was light this morning no said the boy in evident surprise you don t know that cried quilp you were not said quilp you hear what i say kit might have returned some answer which would not have been agreeable to his irascible questioner if the boy from the wharf who had been skulking about the room in search of anything that might have been left about by accident had not happened to cry here s a bird what s to be done with this wring its neck rejoined quilp give it here give it to me you dogs roared quilp fight for it you dogs or i ll wring its neck myself without further persuasion the two boys fell upon each other tooth and nail while quilp holding up the cage in one hand and chopping the ground with his knife in an ecstasy urged them on by his taunts and cries to fight more fiercely they were a pretty equal match and rolled about together exchanging blows which were by no means child s play until at length kit planting a well directed hit in his adversary s chest disengaged himself sprung nimbly up and snatching the cage from quilp s hands made off with his prize there was no need of any caution this time and no fear of being detained by having to play out a return match with daniel quilp s boy his own earnest wish coupled with the assurance he had received from quilp filled him with the belief that she would yet arrive to claim the humble shelter he had offered and from the death of each day s hope another hope sprung up to live to morrow a set of idle chatterboxes how should they know they may be wrong of course returned the mother i can t tell about that though i don t think it s at all unlikely that they re in the right for the talk is that the old gentleman had put by a little money that nobody knew of not even that ugly little man you talk to me about what s his name quilp and that he and miss nell have gone to live abroad where it can t be taken from them and they will never be disturbed what s that about six pound a year what about six pound a year and as the voice made this inquiry daniel quilp walked in with richard swiveller at his heels who said he was to have six pound a year said quilp looking sharply round richard swiveller took an easy observation of the family over mr quilp s head and quilp himself with his hands in his pockets smiled in an exquisite enjoyment of the commotion he occasioned don t be frightened mistress said quilp after a pause mind you don t break out again you villain said quilp looking sternly at him or i ll make faces at you and throw you into fits i will here mistress said quilp turning quickly away and appealing from kit to his mother if you re the gentleman named mr quilp i should have thought you d have known and so i told him only this very day humph muttered quilp evidently disappointed to believe that this was true quilp glanced at richard swiveller and observed that having met him on the threshold he assumed that he had come in search of some intelligence of the fugitives you seem disappointed observed quilp quilp plainly discerned that there was some secret reason for this visit and his uncommon disappointment and in the hope that there might be means of mischief lurking beneath it resolved to worm it out i am disappointed myself said quilp out of mere friendly feeling for them but you have real reasons private reasons i have no doubt for your disappointment and therefore it comes heavier than mine as we are companions in adversity shall we be companions in the surest way of forgetting it if you had no particular business now to lead you in another direction urged quilp plucking him by the sleeve and looking slyly up into his face out of the corners of his eyes there is a house by the water side where they have some of the noblest schiedam reputed to be smuggled but that s between ourselves that can be got in all the world by the time he had finished dick was looking down at quilp in the same sly manner as quilp was looking up at him and there remained nothing more to be done but to set out for the house in question the moment their backs were turned little jacob thawed and resumed his crying from the point where quilp had frozen him the summer house of which mr quilp had spoken was a rugged wooden box rotten and bare to see which overhung the river s mud and threatened to slide down into it to this inviting spot entreating him to observe its beauties as they passed along mr quilp led richard swiveller and on the table of the summer house scored deep with many a gallows and initial letter there soon appeared a wooden keg full of the vaunted liquor drawing it off into the glasses with the skill of a practised hand and mixing it with about a third part of water mr quilp assigned to richard swiveller his portion and lighting his pipe from an end of a candle in a very old and battered lantern drew himself together upon a seat and puffed away is it good said quilp as richard swiveller smacked his lips is it strong and fiery does it make you wink and choke and your eyes water and your breath come short does it does it cried dick throwing away part of the contents of his glass and filling it up with water why man you don t mean to tell me that you drink such fire as this no rejoined quilp not drink it look here not drink it as he spoke daniel quilp drew off and drank three small glassfuls of the raw spirit and then with a horrible grimace took a great many pulls at his pipe and swallowing the smoke discharged it in a heavy cloud from his nose give us a toast cried quilp rattling on the table in a dexterous manner with his fist and elbow alternately in a kind of tune a woman a beauty immolating herself upon the shrine of cheggs poison cheggs cut cheggs s ears off rejoined quilp this candid declaration tended rather to increase than restrain mr quilp s eccentricities and richard swiveller astonished to see him in such a roystering vein and drinking not a little himself for company began imperceptibly to become more companionable and confiding so that being judiciously led on by mr quilp he grew at last very confiding indeed having once got him into this mood and knowing now the key note to strike whenever he was at a loss daniel quilp s task was comparatively an easy one and he was soon in possession of the whole details of the scheme contrived between the easy dick and his more designing friend stop said quilp with these hasty words daniel quilp withdrew into a dismantled skittle ground behind the public house and throwing himself upon the ground actually screamed and rolled about in uncontrollable delight it was this shallow pated fellow who made my bones ache t other day was it it was his friend and fellow plotter mr trent that once made eyes at mrs quilp and leered and looked was it after labouring for two or three years in their precious scheme to find that they ve got a beggar at last and one of them tied for life ha ha ha in the height of his ecstasy mr quilp had like to have met with a disagreeable check for rolling very near a broken dog kennel there leapt forth a large fierce dog who but that his chain was of the shortest would have given him a disagreeable salute why don t you come and bite me why don t you come and tear me to pieces you coward said quilp hissing and worrying the animal till he was nearly mad having by this means composed his spirits and put himself in a pleasant train he returned to his unsuspicious companion whom he found looking at the tide with exceeding gravity and thinking of that same gold and silver which mr quilp had mentioned chapter 23 mr richard swiveller wending homeward from the wilderness for such was the appropriate name of quilp s choice retreat after a sinuous and corkscrew fashion with many checks and stumbles after stopping suddenly and staring about him then as suddenly running forward for a few paces and as suddenly halting again and shaking his head doing everything with a jerk and nothing by premeditation mr richard swiveller wending his way homeward after this fashion which is considered by evil minded men to be symbolical of intoxication and is not held by such persons to denote that state of deep wisdom and reflection in which the actor knows himself to be began to think that possibly he had misplaced his confidence and that the dwarf might not be precisely the sort of person to whom to entrust a secret of such delicacy and importance casting his eyes down towards that quarter in which with reference to a man s face his legs are usually to be found he observed that the face had a body attached and when he looked more intently he was satisfied that the person was mr quilp who indeed had been in his company all the time but whom he had some vague idea of having left a mile or two behind i i m a second father to you replied quilp what a funny fellow you are cried quilp then he told his secret over again with the addition of being pathetic on the subject of miss wackles who he gave mr quilp to understand was the occasion of any slight incoherency he might observe in his speech at that moment which was attributable solely to the strength of his affection and not to rosy wine or other fermented liquor i m as sharp said quilp to him at parting as sharp as a ferret and as cunning as a weazel but they look smaller than they really are on that account said quilp pressing his arm i not a choice spirit cried quilp quilp glanced at his free spoken friend with a mingled expression of cunning and dislike and wringing his hand almost at the same moment declared that he was an uncommon character and had his warmest esteem with that they parted mr swiveller to make the best of his way home and sleep himself sober and quilp to cogitate upon the discovery he had made and exult in the prospect of the rich field of enjoyment and reprisal it opened to him it was not without great reluctance and misgiving that mr swiveller next morning his head racked by the fumes of the renowned schiedam repaired to the lodging of his friend trent which was in the roof of an old house in an old ghostly inn and recounted by very slow degrees what had yesterday taken place between him and quilp nor was it without great surprise and much speculation on quilp s probable motives nor without many bitter comments on dick swiveller s folly that his friend received the tale without inquiring whether salamanders were of necessity good confidential agents or whether a fire proof man was as a matter of course trustworthy frederick trent threw himself into a chair and burying his head in his hands endeavoured to fathom the motives which had led quilp to insinuate himself into richard swiveller s confidence for that the disclosure was of his seeking and had not been spontaneously revealed by dick was sufficiently plain from quilp s seeking his company and enticing him away but knowing the scheme they had planned why should he offer to assist it this was a question more difficult of solution but as knaves generally overreach themselves by imputing their own designs to others the idea immediately presented itself that some circumstances of irritation between quilp and the old man arising out of their secret transactions and not unconnected perhaps with his sudden disappearance now rendered the former desirous of revenging himself upon him by seeking to entrap the sole object of his love and anxiety into a connexion of which he knew he had a dread and hatred as frederick trent himself utterly regardless of his sister had this object at heart only second to the hope of gain it seemed to him the more likely to be quilp s main principle of action having revolved these things in his mind and arrived at this conclusion he communicated to mr swiveller as much of his meditations as he thought proper dick would have been perfectly satisfied with less and giving him the day to recover himself from his late salamandering accompanied him at evening to mr quilp s house mighty glad mr quilp was to see them or mightily glad he seemed to be and fearfully polite mr quilp was to mrs quilp and mrs jiniwin and very sharp was the look he cast on his wife to observe how she was affected by the recognition of young trent mrs quilp was as innocent as her own mother of any emotion painful or pleasant which the sight of him awakened but as her husband s glance made her timid and confused and uncertain what to do or what was required of her mr quilp did not fail to assign her embarrassment to the cause he had in his mind and while he chuckled at his penetration was secretly exasperated by his jealousy on the contrary mr quilp was all blandness and suavity and presided over the case bottle of rum with extraordinary open heartedness why let me see said quilp nearer three cried quilp does it seem as long as that to you mrs quilp yes i think it seems full three years quilp was the unfortunate reply oh indeed ma am thought quilp you have been pining have you very good ma am it seems to me but yesterday that you went out to demerara in the mary anne said quilp but yesterday i declare mr quilp accompanied this admission with such an awful wink indicative of old rovings and backslidings that mrs jiniwin was indignant and could not forbear from remarking under her breath that he might at least put off his confessions until his wife was absent for which act of boldness and insubordination mr quilp first stared her out of countenance and then drank her health ceremoniously i always thought that said quilp setting down his glass ha ha ha the young man smiled but not as though the theme was the most agreeable one that could have been selected for his entertainment and for that reason quilp pursued it the young man made a movement of impatience but quilp went on as calmly as if he were discussing some abstract question in which nobody present had the slightest personal interest it s very true said quilp that your grandfather urged repeated forgiveness ingratitude riot and extravagance and all that but as i told him these are common faults i wonder at that mr quilp said the young man sarcastically well so did i at the time returned quilp but he was always obstinate agreed returned quilp agreed on my part readily after a moment s hesitation the young man stretched out his to meet it quilp clutched his fingers in a grip that for the moment stopped the current of the blood within them and pressing his other hand upon his lip and frowning towards the unsuspicious richard released them and sat down it being now mr quilp s cue to change the subject with all convenient expedition lest richard swiveller in his heedlessness should reveal anything which it was inexpedient for the women to know he proposed a game at four handed cribbage and partners being cut for mrs quilp fell to frederick trent and dick himself to quilp mrs jiniwin being very fond of cards was carefully excluded by her son in law from any participation in the game and had assigned to her the duty of occasionally replenishing the glasses from the case bottle mr quilp from that moment keeping one eye constantly upon her lest she should by any means procure a taste of the same and thereby tantalising the wretched old lady who was as much attached to the case bottle as the cards in a double degree and most ingenious manner but it was not to mrs jiniwin alone that mr quilp s attention was restricted as several other matters required his constant vigilance mrs quilp too was the partner of young trent and for every look that passed between them and every word they spoke and every card they played the dwarf had eyes and ears not occupied alone with what was passing above the table but with signals that might be exchanging beneath it which he laid all kinds of traps to detect besides often treading on his wife s toes to see whether she cried out or remained silent under the infliction in which latter case it would have been quite clear that trent had been treading on her toes before yet in the most of all these distractions the one eye was upon the old lady always and if she so much as stealthily advanced a tea spoon towards a neighbouring glass which she often did for the purpose of abstracting but one sup of its sweet contents quilp s hand would overset it in the very moment of her triumph and quilp s mocking voice implore her to regard her precious health and in any one of these his many cares from first to last quilp never flagged nor faltered at length when they had played a great many rubbers and drawn pretty freely upon the case bottle mr quilp warned his lady to retire to rest and that submissive wife complying and being followed by her indignant mother mr swiveller fell asleep it s as well not to say more than one can help before our worthy friend said quilp making a grimace towards the slumbering dick of course i have dear fred said quilp grinning to think how little he suspected what the real end was it s done fred rejoined quilp stretching out his clenched hand and opening it as if he had let some weight fall out quilp shook his head and said that point remained to be discovered which it might be easily after a few words of confidence in the result of their project had been exchanged they bade the grinning quilp good night quilp crept to the window as they passed in the street below and listened in this hatching of their scheme neither trent nor quilp had had one thought about the happiness or misery of poor innocent nell the instant he appeared she recognised him who could have failed to recognise in that instant the ugly misshapen quilp the street beyond was so narrow and the shadow of the houses on one side of the way so deep that he seemed to have risen out of the earth faster sirrah cried quilp looking up at the old gateway and showing in the moonlight like some monstrous image that had come down from its niche and was casting a backward glance at its old house faster it s a dreadful heavy load sir the boy pleaded you have come fast considering retorted quilp you creep you dog you crawl you measure distance like a worm come on then said quilp or i shall be too late the boy made all the speed he could and quilp led onward constantly turning back to threaten him and urge him to greater haste these reflections did not remove her own alarm for she had been too much terrified to be easily composed and felt as if she were hemmed in by a legion of quilps and the very air itself were filled with them notwithstanding these protections she could get none but broken sleep by fits and starts all night for fear of quilp who throughout her uneasy dreams was somehow connected with the wax work or was wax work himself or was mrs jarley and wax work too or was himself mrs jarley wax work and a barrel organ all in one and yet not exactly any of them either as it went jolting through the streets nell peeped from the window curious to see in what kind of place they were and yet fearful of encountering at every turn the dreaded face of quilp as her popularity procured her various little fees from the visitors on which her patroness never demanded any toll and as her grandfather too was well treated and useful she had no cause of anxiety in connexion with the wax work beyond that which sprung from her recollection of quilp and her fears that he might return and one day suddenly encounter them quilp indeed was a perpetual night mare to the child who was constantly haunted by a vision of his ugly face and stunted figure look here daniel quilp esquire daniel quilp esquire daniel quilp esquire all through as mr brass and miss sally looked up to ascertain the cause the top sash was nimbly lowered from without and quilp thrust in his head upon my word it s quite extraordinary open the door said quilp i ve got him here there she is said quilp stopping short at the door and wrinkling up his eyebrows as he looked towards miss sally there is the woman i ought to have married there is the beautiful sarah there is the female who has all the charms of her sex and none of their weaknesses oh sally sally to this amorous address miss brass briefly responded bother hard hearted as the metal from which she takes her name said quilp why don t she change it melt down the brass and take another name hold your nonsense mr quilp do returned miss sally with a grim smile the strange young man said quilp handing dick swiveller forward is too susceptible himself not to understand me well what a delicious atmosphere if mr quilp spoke figuratively and meant to imply that the air breathed by miss sally brass was sweetened and rarefied by that dainty creature he had doubtless good reason for what he said mr swiveller said quilp being pretty well accustomed to the agricultural pursuits of sowing wild oats miss sally prudently considers that half a loaf is better than no bread you may be very proud sir to have the friendship of mr quilp miss sally will teach him law the delightful study of the law said quilp she ll be his guide his friend his companion his blackstone his coke upon littleton his young lawyer s best companion with miss sally quilp went on and the beautiful fictions of the law his days will pass like minutes it s a treat to hear him where will mr swiveller sit said quilp looking round in the meantime if mr swiveller will take my seat and try his hand at a fair copy of this ejectment as i shall be out pretty well all the morning walk with me said quilp it s not everybody sir who has an opportunity of improving himself by the conversation of mr quilp quilp offers me this place which he says he can insure me resumed dick after a thoughtful silence and telling off the circumstances of his position one by one upon his fingers fred who i could have taken my affidavit would not have heard of such a thing backs quilp to my astonishment and urges me to take it also staggerer number one my aunt in the country stops the supplies and writes an affectionate note to say that she has made a new will and left me out of it staggerer number two the nightly absence of the old man the solitary existence of the child at those times his illness and recovery quilp s possession of the house and their sudden disappearance were all the subjects of much questioning and answer in his desperation and restlessness kit cast his eyes about the chapel and happening to let them fall upon a little seat in front of the clerk s desk could scarcely believe them when they showed him quilp he rubbed them twice or thrice but still they insisted that quilp was there and there indeed he was sitting with his hands upon his knees and his hat between them on a little wooden bracket with the accustomed grin on his dirty face and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling so saying kit marched out of the chapel followed by his mother and little jacob and found himself in the open air with an indistinct recollection of having seen the people wake up and look surprised and of quilp having remained throughout the interruption in his old attitude without moving his eyes from the ceiling or appearing to take the smallest notice of anything that passed goodness gracious me cried kit s mother falling back in extreme surprise only think of this she had some reason to be astonished for the person who proffered the gracious invitation was no other than daniel quilp would you do me the honour said quilp oh said quilp such a dear lady such a worthy woman so blest in her honest son how is christopher s mother have change of air and scene improved her her little family too and christopher do they thrive do they flourish are they growing into worthy citizens eh making his voice ascend in the scale with every succeeding question mr quilp finished in a shrill squeak and subsided into the panting look which was customary with him and which whether it were assumed or natural had equally the effect of banishing all expression from his face and rendering it as far as it afforded any index to his mood or meaning a perfect blank mr quilp said the single gentleman we two have met before surely cried quilp nodding his head by no means you may remember that the day i arrived in london and found the house to which i drove empty and deserted i was directed by some of the neighbours to you and waited upon you without stopping for rest or refreshment how precipitate that was and yet what an earnest and vigorous measure said quilp conferring with himself in imitation of his friend mr sampson brass we had warrant for what we did my good sir rejoined quilp we had our warrant yes he was gone said quilp with the same exasperating composure now what am i to think said the single gentleman sternly regarding him of you who plainly indisposed to give me any information then nay obviously holding back and sheltering yourself with all kinds of cunning trickery and evasion are dogging my footsteps now i dogging cried quilp were you not a few hours since sixty miles off and in the chapel to which this good woman goes to say her prayers she was there too i think said quilp still perfectly unmoved that quilp lied most heartily in this speech it needed no very great penetration to discover although for anything that he suffered to appear in his face voice or manner he might have been clinging to the truth with the quiet constancy of a martyr in the name of all that s calculated to drive one crazy man said the unfortunate single gentleman have you not for some reason of your own taken upon yourself my errand don t you know with what object i have come here and if you do know can you throw no light upon it you think i m a conjuror sir replied quilp shrugging up his shoulders willingly returned quilp oho are you there my friend in deed chuckling as though in very great glee and recompensing himself for the restraint he had lately put upon his countenance by twisting it into all imaginable varieties of ugliness mr quilp rocking himself to and fro in his chair and nursing his left leg at the same time fell into certain meditations of which it may be necessary to relate the substance of this determination mr quilp expressed his high approval and setting himself in the same breath to goad mr swiveller on to further hints soon made out that the single gentleman had been seen in communication with kit and that this was the secret which was never to be disclosed possessed of this piece of information mr quilp directly supposed that the single gentleman above stairs must be the same individual who had waited on him and having assured himself by further inquiries that this surmise was correct had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the intent and object of his correspondence with kit was the recovery of his old client and the child quilp kept the chaise in sight mingled with the crowd learnt the single gentleman s errand and its failure and having possessed himself of all that it was material to know hurried off reached the inn before him had the interview just now detailed and shut himself up in the little room in which he hastily reviewed all these occurrences i hate your virtuous people said the dwarf throwing off a bumper of brandy and smacking his lips ah i hate em every one this was not a mere empty vaunt but a deliberate avowal of his real sentiments for mr quilp who loved nobody had by little and little come to hate everybody nearly or remotely connected with his ruined client the old man himself because he had been able to deceive him and elude his vigilance the child because she was the object of mrs quilp s commiseration and constant self reproach the single gentleman because of his unconcealed aversion to himself kit and his mother most mortally for the reasons shown above and beyond that general feeling of opposition to them which would have been inseparable from his ravenous desire to enrich himself by these altered circumstances daniel quilp hated them every one in this amiable mood mr quilp enlivened himself and his hatreds with more brandy and then changing his quarters withdrew to an obscure alehouse under cover of which seclusion he instituted all possible inquiries that might lead to the discovery of the old man and his grandchild it was some gratification to mr quilp to find as he took his place upon the roof that kit s mother was alone inside from which circumstance he derived in the course of the journey much cheerfulness of spirit inasmuch as her solitary condition enabled him to terrify her with many extraordinary annoyances such as hanging over the side of the coach at the risk of his life and staring in with his great goggle eyes which seemed in hers the more horrible from his face being upside down dodging her in this way from one window to another getting nimbly down whenever they changed horses and thrusting his head in at the window with a dismal squint which ingenious tortures had such an effect upon mrs nubbles that she was quite unable for the time to resist the belief that mr quilp did in his own person represent and embody that evil power who was so vigorously attacked at little bethel and who by reason of her backslidings in respect of astley s and oysters was now frolicsome and rampant kit having been apprised by letter of his mother s intended return was waiting for her at the coach office and great was his surprise when he saw leering over the coachman s shoulder like some familiar demon invisible to all eyes but his the well known face of quilp mr quilp was serenely gazing at the stars quite absorbed in celestial contemplation i say sir mr quilp affected to start and looked smilingly round an t you ashamed of yourself you little monster monster said quilp inwardly with a smile ugliest dwarf that could be seen anywhere for a penny monster ah you show her any of your impudence again resumed kit shouldering the bandbox and i tell you what mr quilp i won t bear with you any more quilp said not a word in reply but walking so close to kit as to bring his eyes within two or three inches of his face looked fixedly at him retreated a little distance without averting his gaze approached again again withdrew and so on for half a dozen times like a head in a phantasmagoria kit stood his ground as if in expectation of an immediate assault but finding that nothing came of these gestures snapped his fingers and walked away his mother dragging him off as fast as she could and even in the midst of his news of little jacob and the baby looking anxiously over her shoulder to see if quilp were following chapter 49 kit s mother might have spared herself the trouble of looking back so often for nothing was further from mr quilp s thoughts than any intention of pursuing her and her son or renewing the quarrel with which they had parted he went his way whistling from time to time some fragments of a tune and with a face quite tranquil and composed jogged pleasantly towards home entertaining himself as he went with visions of the fears and terrors of mrs quilp who having received no intelligence of him for three whole days and two nights and having had no previous notice of his absence was doubtless by that time in a state of distraction and constantly fainting away with anxiety and grief in this happy flow of spirits mr quilp reached tower hill when gazing up at the window of his own sitting room he thought he descried more light than is usual in a house of mourning a light in the passage said quilp peeping through the keyhole but after a second application to the knocker no louder than the first the door was softly opened by the boy from the wharf whom quilp instantly gagged with one hand and dragged into the street with the other who s up stairs you dog retorted quilp in the same tone the boy could only point to the window and reply with a stifled giggle expressive of such intense enjoyment that quilp clutched him by the throat and might have carried his threat into execution or at least have made very good progress towards that end but for the boy s nimbly extricating himself from his grasp and fortifying himself behind the nearest post at which after some fruitless attempts to catch him by the hair of the head his master was obliged to come to a parley will you answer me said quilp ha ha ha dead cried quilp relaxing into a grim laugh himself ha ha the prospect of playing the spy under such delicious circumstances and of disappointing them all by walking in alive gave more delight to quilp than the greatest stroke of good fortune could possibly have inspired him with not a word said quilp making towards the door on tiptoe drowned eh mrs quilp drowned so saying he blew out the candle kicked off his shoes and groped his way up stairs leaving his delighted young friend in an ecstasy of summersets on the pavement the bedroom door on the staircase being unlocked mr quilp slipped in and planted himself behind the door of communication between that chamber and the sitting room which standing ajar to render both more airy and having a very convenient chink of which he had often availed himself for purposes of espial and had indeed enlarged with his pocket knife enabled him not only to hear but to see distinctly what was passing if i could poison that dear old lady s rum and water murmured quilp i d die happy do we say crooked i think they were a little so observed mrs quilp with a sob bless your eyes how i love you muttered quilp aquiline cried quilp thrusting in his head and striking the feature with his fist excellent how very good he is he s a most remarkable man so extremely whimsical such an amazing power of taking people by surprise quilp paid no regard whatever to these compliments nor to the dubious and frightened look into which the lawyer gradually subsided nor to the shrieks of his wife and mother in law nor to the latter s running from the room nor to the former s fainting away not yet sampson said quilp ha ha ha oh very rich very rich indeed remarkably so waiting until mr brass s ejaculations died away in the distance for he continued to pour them out all the way down stairs quilp advanced towards the two men who yet lingered in a kind of stupid amazement the speedy clearance effected quilp locked the doors and still embracing the case bottle with shrugged up shoulders and folded arms stood looking at his insensible wife like a dismounted nightmare those of mr and mrs quilp however were an exception to the general rule the remarks which they occasioned being limited to a long soliloquy on the part of the gentleman with perhaps a few deprecatory observations from the lady not extending beyond a trembling monosyllable uttered at long intervals and in a very submissive and humble tone on the present occasion mrs quilp did not for a long time venture even on this gentle defence but when she had recovered from her fainting fit sat in a tearful silence meekly listening to the reproaches of her lord and master of these mr quilp delivered himself with the utmost animation and rapidity and with so many distortions of limb and feature that even his wife although tolerably well accustomed to his proficiency in these respects was well nigh beside herself with alarm but the jamaica rum and the joy of having occasioned a heavy disappointment by degrees cooled mr quilp s wrath which from being at savage heat dropped slowly to the bantering or chuckling point at which it steadily remained so you thought i was dead and gone did you said quilp indeed quilp returned his wife i am glad to see you quilp indeed i am in truth mrs quilp did seem a great deal more glad to behold her lord than might have been expected and did evince a degree of interest in his safety which all things considered was rather unaccountable upon quilp however this circumstance made no impression farther than as it moved him to snap his fingers close to his wife s eyes with divers grins of triumph and derision how could you be so cruel quilp how could i be so cruel cruel cried the dwarf you can t be serious quilp sobbed his wife tom scott where s tom scott here i am master cried the voice of the boy as quilp threw up the window pack it up mrs quilp halloa there halloa with these exclamations mr quilp caught up the poker and hurrying to the door of the good lady s sleeping closet beat upon it therewith until she awoke in inexpressible terror thinking that her amiable son in law surely intended to murder her in justification of the legs she had slandered somewhat reassured by her account of the service she was required to render mrs jiniwin made her appearance in a flannel dressing gown and both mother and daughter trembling with terror and cold for the night was now far advanced obeyed mr quilp s directions in submissive silence consigning his heavier burden to the care of tom scott when he reached the street taking a dram from the bottle for his own encouragement and giving the boy a rap on the head with it as a small taste for himself quilp very deliberately led the way to the wharf and reached it at between three and four o clock in the morning snug said quilp when he had groped his way to the wooden counting house and opened the door with a key he carried about with him being roused in the morning at the appointed time and roused with difficulty after his late fatigues quilp instructed tom scott to make a fire in the yard of sundry pieces of old timber and to prepare some coffee for breakfast for the better furnishing of which repast he entrusted him with certain small moneys to be expended in the purchase of hot rolls butter sugar yarmouth bloaters and other articles of housekeeping so that in a few minutes a savoury meal was smoking on the board with this substantial comfort the dwarf regaled himself to his heart s content and being highly satisfied with this free and gipsy mode of life which he had often meditated as offering whenever he chose to avail himself of it an agreeable freedom from the restraints of matrimony and a choice means of keeping mrs quilp and her mother in a state of incessant agitation and suspense bestirred himself to improve his retreat and render it more commodious and comfortable dick said the dwarf thrusting his head in at the door my pet my pupil the apple of my eye hey hey oh you re there are you returned mr swiveller how are you how s dick retorted quilp you re out of spirits said quilp drawing up a chair quilp looked at his companion with his eyes screwed up into a comical expression of curiosity and patiently awaited his further explanation upon which however mr swiveller appeared in no hurry to enter as he ate a very long dinner in profound silence finally pushed away his plate threw himself back into his chair folded his arms and stared ruefully at the fire in which some ends of cigars were smoking on their own account and sending up a fragrant odour what do you mean said quilp disguising his secret joy in mr swiveller s defeat daniel quilp adopted the surest means of soothing him by ringing the bell and ordering in a supply of rosy wine that is to say of its usual representative which he put about with great alacrity calling upon mr swiveller to pledge him in various toasts derisive of cheggs and eulogistic of the happiness of single men ha said quilp don t no because he has never seen him rejoined quilp but if we were to bring them together who knows dick but fred properly introduced would serve his turn almost as well as little nell or her grandfather who knows but it might make the young fellow s fortune and through him yours eh why the fact is you see said mr swiveller that they have been brought together quilp was plainly staggered by this intelligence over which he brooded for some time in moody silence often raising his eyes to mr swiveller s face and sharply scanning its expression pursuing these thoughts and gasping as he went along after his own peculiar fashion mr quilp once more crossed the thames and shut himself up in his bachelor s hall which by reason of its newly erected chimney depositing the smoke inside the room and carrying none of it off was not quite so agreeable as more fastidious people might have desired in the midst of this atmosphere which must infallibly have smothered any other man mr quilp passed the evening with great cheerfulness solacing himself all the time with the pipe and the case bottle and occasionally entertaining himself with a melodious howl intended for a song but bearing not the faintest resemblance to any scrap of any piece of music vocal or instrumental ever invented by man peeping cautiously over the side of his hammock he descried mrs quilp to whom after contemplating her for some time in silence he communicated a violent start by suddenly yelling out halloa oh quilp cried his poor little wife looking up what do you want here i m dead an t i oh please come home do come home said mrs quilp sobbing we ll never do so any more quilp and after all it was only a mistake that grew out of our anxiety will you begone mrs quilp durst only make a gesture of entreaty no o o o o roared quilp will you go mr quilp delivered this last command in such a very energetic voice and moreover accompanied it with such a sudden gesture indicative of an intention to spring out of his hammock and night capped as he was bear his wife home again through the public streets that she sped away like an arrow so mr quilp climbed up to the top of a tall stool to write the note and the small servant carefully tutored for such emergencies looked on with her eyes wide open ready if he so much as abstracted a wafer to rush into the street and give the alarm to the police as mr quilp folded his note which was soon written being a very short one he encountered the gaze of the small servant do they use you ill here is your mistress a tartar said quilp with a chuckle whether there was anything in the peculiar slyness of her action which fascinated mr quilp or anything in the expression of her features at the moment which attracted his attention for some other reason or whether it merely occurred to him as a pleasant whim to stare the small servant out of countenance certain it is that he planted his elbows square and firmly on the desk and squeezing up his cheeks with his hands looked at her fixedly nonsense retorted quilp quilp however without uttering another word withdrew his eyes from the small servant stroked his chin more thoughtfully than before and then bending over the note as if to direct it with scrupulous and hair breadth nicety looked at her covertly but very narrowly from under his bushy eyebrows nevertheless it was in this choice retreat that mr quilp ordered a cold collation to be prepared and it was beneath its cracked and leaky roof that he in due course of time received mr sampson and his sister sally you re fond of the beauties of nature said quilp with a grin cool said quilp perhaps a little damp and ague ish said quilp sweet sally cried quilp extending his arms as if about to embrace her quilp however who beyond the gratification of his demon whims owed sampson some acknowledgment of the part he had played in the mourning scene of which he had been a hidden witness marked these symptoms of uneasiness with a delight past all expression and derived from them a secret joy which the costliest banquet could never have afforded him while mr quilp in his uproarious hospitality seated himself upon an empty beer barrel vaunted the place as the most beautiful and comfortable in the three kingdoms and elevating his glass drank to their next merry meeting in that jovial spot and mr brass with the rain plashing down into his tea cup made a dismal attempt to pluck up his spirits and appear at his ease and tom scott who was in waiting at the door under an old umbrella exulted in his agonies and bade fair to split his sides with laughing while all this was passing miss sally brass unmindful of the wet which dripped down upon her own feminine person and fair apparel sat placidly behind the tea board erect and grizzly contemplating the unhappiness of her brother with a mind at ease and content in her amiable disregard of self to sit there all night witnessing the torments which his avaricious and grovelling nature compelled him to endure and forbade him to resent in the height of his boisterous merriment mr quilp having on some pretence dismissed his attendant sprite for the moment resumed his usual manner all at once dismounted from his cask and laid his hand upon the lawyer s sleeve i shall deprive you of a treat said quilp be this as it may quilp gave him no time for correction as he performed that office himself by more than tapping him on the head with the handle of his umbrella why that s right cried quilp right again exclaimed quilp with another contemptuous look at sampson always foremost i say sally he is a yelping insolent dog to all besides and most of all to me no it s not enough sir sneered quilp will you hear me out besides that i owe him a grudge on that account he thwarts me at this minute and stands between me and an end which might otherwise prove a golden one to us all then give me your hand retorted quilp resuming his boisterous manner with the same ease with which he had thrown it off quilp was in an instant the same uproarious reckless little savage he had been a few seconds before spring a beautiful and happy time chapter 56 a day or two after the quilp tea party at the wilderness mr swiveller walked into sampson brass s office at the usual hour and being alone in that temple of probity placed his hat upon the desk and taking from his pocket a small parcel of black crape applied himself to folding and pinning the same upon it after the manner of a hatband on that occasion kit said mr brass on that occasion that i have just alluded to i had a hard battle with mr quilp for mr quilp is a very hard man to obtain them the indulgence they had they sometimes go to see mr quilp said the small servant with a shrewd look they go to a many places bless you is mr brass a wunner said dick absorbed in these painful ruminations thinking with a drooping heart of his mother and little jacob feeling as though even the consciousness of innocence would be insufficient to support him in the presence of his friends if they believed him guilty and sinking in hope and courage more and more as they drew nearer to the notary s poor kit was looking earnestly out of the window observant of nothing when all at once as though it had been conjured up by magic he became aware of the face of quilp blessings on all the world with such good wishes and farewells poured out in a rapid torrent until they were out of hearing quilp suffered them to depart and when he could see the coach no longer drew in his head and rolled upon the ground in an ecstacy of enjoyment chapter 62 a faint light twinkling from the window of the counting house on quilp s wharf and looking inflamed and red through the night fog as though it suffered from it like an eye forewarned mr sampson brass as he approached the wooden cabin with a cautious step that the excellent proprietor his esteemed client was inside and probably waiting with his accustomed patience and sweetness of temper the fulfilment of the appointment which now brought mr brass within his fair domain hark now he s singing mr quilp was certainly entertaining himself with vocal exercise but it was rather a kind of chant than a song being a monotonous repetition of one sentence in a very rapid manner with a long stress upon the last word which he swelled into a dismal roar every time he came to this concluding word and had exhausted all possible stress upon it quilp burst into a shriek of laughter and began again come in you false witness you perjurer you suborner of evidence come in he has the richest humour cried brass shutting the door behind him the most amazing vein of comicality but isn t it rather injudicious sir what demanded quilp now i look at it again i fancy i see a yes there certainly is something in the smile that reminds me of and yet upon my word i now the fact was that sampson having never seen anything in the smallest degree resembling this substantial phantom was much perplexed being uncertain whether mr quilp considered it like himself and had therefore bought it for a family portrait or whether he was pleased to consider it as the likeness of some enemy although this might have been a very comical thing to look at from a secure gallery as a bull fight is found to be a comfortable spectacle by those who are not in the arena and a house on fire is better than a play to people who don t live near it there was something in the earnestness of mr quilp s manner which made his legal adviser feel that the counting house was a little too small and a deal too lonely for the complete enjoyment of these humours therefore he stood as far off as he could while the dwarf was thus engaged whimpering out but feeble applause and when quilp left off and sat down again from pure exhaustion approached with more obsequiousness than ever extremely entertaining indeed come here said quilp beckoning him to draw near scarcely worth mentioning sir but i thought that song admirably humorous in itself you know was perhaps rather yes said quilp rather what just bordering or as one may say remotely verging upon the confines of injudiciousness perhaps sir returned brass looking timidly at the dwarf s cunning eyes which were turned towards the fire and reflected its red light why inquired quilp without looking up eh said quilp looking up with a perfectly vacant countenance your meaning exactly you brazen scarecrow what s your meaning retorted quilp no said quilp heating some rum in a little saucepan and watching it to prevent its boiling over why not why sir returned brass he dear me mr quilp sir what s the matter said the dwarf stopping his hand in the act of carrying the saucepan to his mouth deigning no other than a practical answer to this remonstrance mr quilp raised the hot saucepan to his lips and deliberately drank off all the spirit it contained which might have been in quantity about half a pint and had been but a moment before when he took it off the fire bubbling and hissing fiercely but first said quilp with his accustomed grin have a drop yourself a nice drop a good warm fiery drop the lodger said quilp what about him he is still sir returned brass with intervals of coughing stopping with the garland family i do indeed mr quilp then now you may discharge him said quilp well sir retorted quilp and do you understand now that they re not poor that they can t be if they have such men as your lodger searching for them and scouring the country far and wide of course i do sir said sampson nothing but the respect and obligation i owe to you sir as it was plain that sampson was bent on a complimentary harangue unless he received a timely interruption mr quilp politely tapped him on the crown of his head with the little saucepan and requested that he would be so obliging as to hold his peace practical sir practical said brass rubbing the place and smiling but still extremely pleasant immensely so hearken to me will you returned quilp or i ll be a little more pleasant presently extremely forcible i hate him said quilp between his teeth and have always hated him for family reasons when would you wish him sir to ha ha to make that little excursion when this trial s over said quilp ah mr quilp i often think sir if it had only pleased providence to bring you and sarah together in earlier life what blessed results would have flowed from such a union you never saw our dear father sir a charming gentleman he would have closed his eyes in bliss would foxey mr quilp if he could have found her such a partner but to these remonstrances mr quilp turned a deaf ear if you d have the goodness to show me a light so that i may see my way across the yard sir quilp was out in an instant not with his legs first or his head first or his arms first but bodily altogether he lives on the right hand said quilp but sometimes he hides on the left ready for a spring there s the light out never mind you know the way straight on quilp had slily shaded the light by holding it against his breast and now stood chuckling and shaking from head to foot in a rapture of delight as he heard the lawyer stumbling up the yard and now and then falling heavily down isn t quilp she says our principal support he certainly is says mr brass and an t we she says constantly ruining somebody or other in the way of business we certainly are says mr brass then does it signify she says about ruining this kit when quilp desires it it certainly does not signify says mr brass then they whispered and laughed for a long time about there being no danger if it was well done and then mr brass pulls out his pocket book and says well he says here it is quilp s own five pound note and if that don t get christopher out of mr quilp s way and satisfy mr quilp s grudges he says the devil s in it while we have no doubt of that or that a proper use of it would procure the poor lad s immediate pardon and liberation we have a great doubt whether it would by itself enable us to reach quilp the chief agent in this villany dick received this project in anything but a gracious manner representing with as much warmth as he was then capable of showing that they would find the old buck meaning sarah more difficult to manage than quilp himself that for any tampering terrifying or cajolery she was a very unpromising and unyielding subject that she was of a kind of brass not easily melted or moulded into shape in short that they were no match for her and would be signally defeated but connected with you two is a third party a villain of the name of quilp the prime mover of the whole diabolical device who i believe to be worse than either gentlemen said brass striking the hat fiercely with his clenched hand to all these questions i answer quilp the three gentlemen looked at each other but said nothing i say pursued brass glancing aside at his sister as though he were talking for her information and speaking with a snarling malignity in violent contrast to his usual smoothness that i answer to all these questions quilp quilp who deludes me into his infernal den and takes a delight in looking on and chuckling while i scorch and burn and bruise and maim myself quilp who never once no never once in all our communications together has treated me otherwise than as a dog quilp whom i have always hated with my whole heart but never so much as lately i yielded from necessity to quilp for though necessity has no law she has her lawyers punish quilp gentlemen it was not finished until evening but being done at last that worthy person and the three friends adjourned in a hackney coach to the private office of a justice who giving mr brass a warm reception and detaining him in a secure place that he might insure to himself the pleasure of seeing him on the morrow dismissed the others with the cheering assurance that a warrant could not fail to be granted next day for the apprehension of mr quilp and that a proper application and statement of all the circumstances to the secretary of state who was fortunately in town would no doubt procure kit s free pardon and liberation without delay and now indeed it seemed that quilp s malignant career was drawing to a close and that retribution which often travels slowly especially when heaviest had tracked his footsteps with a sure and certain scent and was gaining on him fast for please god we ll make a scholar of the poor marchioness yet and she shall walk in silk attire and siller have to spare or may i never rise from this bed again chapter 67 unconscious of the proceedings faithfully narrated in the last chapter and little dreaming of the mine which had been sprung beneath him for to the end that he should have no warning of the business a foot the profoundest secrecy was observed in the whole transaction mr quilp remained shut up in his hermitage undisturbed by any suspicion and extremely well satisfied with the result of his machinations it was the day next after mr brass s confession and consequently that which threatened the restriction of mr quilp s liberty and the abrupt communication to him of some very unpleasant and unwelcome facts only me quilp replied a woman s voice then she s alive said quilp and there s nothing the matter with her toss it in at the window here and go your ways said quilp interrupting her or i ll come out and scratch you no but please quilp do hear me speak urged his submissive wife in tears speak will you it was left at our house this afternoon said mrs quilp trembling by a boy who said he didn t know from whom it came but that it was given to him to leave and that he was told to say it must be brought on to you directly for it was of the very greatest consequence i ll go away directly you tell me to quilp mrs quilp obeyed right willingly and kneeling down before the fire to warm her hands delivered into his a little packet i m glad you re wet said quilp snatching it and squinting at her oh quilp sobbed his wife how cruel it is of you did she think i was dead said quilp wrinkling his face into a most extraordinary series of grimaces did she think she was going to have all the money and to marry somebody she liked ha ha ha did she these taunts elicited no reply from the poor little woman who remained on her knees warming her hands and sobbing to mr quilp s great delight as a matter of course mr quilp lost no time in resorting to the infallible poker with which after some dodging and lying in ambush he paid his young friend one or two such unequivocal compliments that he vanished precipitately and left him in quiet possession of the field to describe the changes that passed over quilp s face as he read this letter half a dozen times would require some new language such for power of expression as was never written read or spoken for a long time he did not utter one word but after a considerable interval during which mrs quilp was almost paralysed with the alarm his looks engendered he contrived to gasp out if i had him here if i only had him here oh quilp said his wife what s the matter who are you angry with i should drown him said the dwarf not heeding her ah to see him those three times and mock him as his face came bobbing up oh what a rich treat that would be quilp stammered his wife venturing at the same time to touch him on the shoulder what has gone wrong she was so terrified by the relish with which he pictured this pleasure to himself that she could scarcely make herself intelligible such a bloodless cur said quilp rubbing his hands very slowly and pressing them tight together do you mind tom nodded sulkily and beckoned mrs quilp to lead the way but quilp what is the matter where are you going do say something more i ll say that said the dwarf seizing her by the arm and do that too which undone and unsaid would be best for you unless you go directly has this letter any connexion with dear little nell i must ask you that i must indeed quilp i don t know what harm i may have brought about but great or little i did it for you quilp it was well he did so for quilp who was nearly mad with rage pursued them to the neighbouring lane and might have prolonged the chase but for the dense mist which obscured them from his view and appeared to thicken every moment if they would knock again said quilp trying to peer into the gloom by which he was surrounded the sound might guide me come batter the gate once more he stood listening intently but the noise was not renewed the body of quilp being found though not until some days had elapsed an inquest was held on it near the spot where it had been washed ashore little mrs quilp never quite forgave herself the one deceit that lay so heavy on her conscience and never spoke or thought of it but with bitter tears sophronia herself supposed she was an orphan but mr swiveller putting various slight circumstances together often thought miss brass must know better than that and having heard from his wife of her strange interview with quilp entertained sundry misgivings whether that person in his lifetime might not also have been able to solve the riddle had he chosen
